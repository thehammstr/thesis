  Abstract                 = {Terrain-aided navigation (TAN), also referred to as terrain correlation, is a technique that has proven to be highly successful as a navigational aid for autonomous, unmanned guided missiles. Qualitatively speaking, the effectiveness of terrain correlation is a function of signal- to-noise (S/N) ratio. The signal is equivalent to terrain roughness, while the noise is the combination of reference map errors, radar altimeter errors, and INS altitude errors. However, it is not practical to use only a single parameter, such as S/N, to define the suitability of terrain correlation. This paper discusses the shortcomings of the conventional single-parameter approach to the terrain contour matching algorithm (TERCOM) used in cruise missile guidance systems scene selection. A more comprehensive technique is then presented that analyzes the terrain correlation suitability based on a Monte Carlo simulation technique. A figure-of-merit (FOM) for terrain correlation suitability, computed from sample statistics, is introduced and simulation results are provided to illustrate the feasibility of using a multi-parameter FOM technique. The preliminary results indicate that the proposed approach could provide a cost effective enhancement to the TAN-based mission planning process.},

  Abstract                 = {Integration of complementary systems like inertial navigation system (INS) and Global Positioning System (GPS), improves navigation parameters accuracy. Currently, integrated navigation systems are commonly implemented using extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The EKF assumes linear process and measurement models while UKF generates sigma points using the real mean and standard deviation of data. However, both EKF and UKF assume the noise to be Gaussian, which is unrealistic for highly nonlinear systems. To overcome these limitations, particle filter (PF) was proposed lately which is a non-parametric filter and hence can easily deal with non-linearity and non-Gaussian noises. In this paper, hybrid extended particle filter (HEPF) is developed as an alternative to the EKF to achieve better navigation accuracy for low-cost micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors. Experimental GPS/INS datasets consisting of GPS carrier phase data and inertial measurements from low-cost MEMS-grade inertial measurement unit (IMU) is used to evaluate the proposed HEPF. The HEPF performance is compared to that of other estimation techniques such as the EKF. The results show that both HEPF and EKF provide comparable navigation results during periods without GPS outages. However in cases when GPS outages are simulated, HEPF performs much better than the EKF, especially when simulated outages are located during periods with high vehicle dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {We address the problem of position trajectory-tracking and path-following control design for underactuated autonomous vehicles in the presence of possibly large modeling parametric uncertainty. For a general class of vehicles moving in either 2- or 3-D space, we demonstrate how adaptive switching supervisory control can be combined with a nonlinear Lyapunov-based tracking control law to solve the problem of global boundedness and convergence of the position tracking error to a neighborhood of the origin that can be made arbitrarily small. The desired trajectory does not need to be of a particular type (e.g., trimming trajectories) and can be any sufficiently smooth bounded curve parameterized by time. We also show how these results can be applied to solve the path-following problem, in which the vehicle is required to converge to and follow a path, without a specific temporal specification. We illustrate our design procedures through two vehicle control applications: a hovercraft (moving on a planar surface) and an underwater vehicle (moving in 3-D space). Simulations results are presented and discussed.},

In previous versions of the system, a prior bathymetric map database has been required, sometimes restricting the use of the system. To relax this requirement, a real-time map generator has been implemented, such that the vehicle is able to build its own map during the mission. When returning to the mapped area, the system can use this map in order to obtain a terrain navigation fix, thus reducing the uncertainty of the navigation system. Results from a sea trial of the concept are presented, in which the system effectively brings the navigation uncertainty down from more than 50 to about 10 meters. Further results, using the system in the traditional manner with a prior map database, are also included.},

In the test described herein, DVL altitude data was used in the terrain navigation system, together with a high quality terrain database. After 5 hours of operation with terrain navigation as the only external position sensor, the horizontal navigation accuracy remained within 5 meters. Offline computations on the same data set show that the terrain navigation algorithms are robust to initial position errors, with the expense of longer convergence times. A comparison of the DVL and map data also revealed a bias that should be investigated further.},

  Abstract                 = {Terrain aided navigation techniques are attractive for obtaining submerged position fixes for an underwater vehicle. However, their use is dependent on a certain degree of variation in the terrain. This paper investigates the performance of terrain navigation algorithms in an area with pockmarks, i.e. craters in the sea bed formed by expulsion of gas or water from the sediments. We use real terrain data from an area with pockmarks, together with simulated vehicle and multibeam echo sounder measurements, to investigate the behavior of the terrain navigation techniques in the area. The simulations indicate that this type of terrain is suitable for terrain aided navigation. The pockmarks also seem to be sufficiently different to provide unique fixes. As pockmarks often occur in flat terrain, traditionally thought of as not suited for terrain navigation, the use of pockmarks facilities terrain navigation in a number of new applications.},

This system is now available as an optional module for the HUGIN vehicles, and has recently been delivered to customers. The paper gives an overview of the HUGIN terrain navigation module and its integration with the rest of the HUGIN navigation system.

  Abstract                 = {This paper focuses on obtaining submerged position fixes for underwater vehicles from comparing bathymetric measurements with a bathymetric map. Our algorithms are tested on real data, collected by a HUGIN AUV equipped with a multibeam echo sounder (MBE). Due to our strongly non-linear and non-Gaussian problem, local linearization methods such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF), has proven unsuitable in many terrain types. We therefore focus on two different recursive Bayesian methods, namely the point mass filter (PMF) and a Bayesian bootstrap particle filter (PF). The PMF is a gridbased approximation method, whereas the PF is a sequential Monte Carlo method, based on sampling from the underlying distributions. The two methods are first compared using a 2- dimensional state-space model, only estimating the horizontal position of the vehicle. A problem with this approach is that uncertainty in the estimation of tidal levels may lead to large errors in the depth measurements. To counter this, one may extend the state vector to three dimensions, and this is investigated in the paper. Characteristics such as accuracy, convergence time, terrain dependency, and computational demands for the two methods are compared. In suited terrain both methods yield a horizontal accuracy comparable to the resolution of the map. The results from the PMF are slightly better, but the PMF is also more computationally demanding than the PF. Extending the methods from 2D to 3D makes them significally more robust to depth errors. The computational demands for the PMF increases dramatically in 3D, whereas they are virtually unchanged for the PF. Previous problems of overconfidence in these methods are effectively reduced through sub-sampling of the MBE data.},

  Abstract                 = {Increasingly, for many application areas, it is becoming important to include elements of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity in order to model accurately the underlying dynamics of a physical system. Moreover, it is typically crucial to process data on-line as it arrives, both from the point of view of storage costs as well as for rapid adaptation to changing signal characteristics. In this paper, we review both optimal and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or "particle") representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as SIR, ASIR, and RPF are introduced within a generic framework of the sequential importance sampling (SIS) algorithm. These are discussed and compared with the standard EKF through an illustrative example},

The basis of the system is an in-house development of an Integrated Pedestrian Navigation System, based on 2 low-cost IMUs, an electronic compass and an altimeter with a drifting navigation solution. Combining this system with an additional laser ranger and SLAM algorithms, we are able to build accurate maps of office buildings for already visited rooms in post processing. This paper presents a map matching algorithm based on a new reduced particle filter in order to use these maps later for real-time applications without an expensive laser ranger but relying only on the dual inertial system. It can be used with both, preprocessed SLAM maps or with already available maps. Finally to smooth the resulting trajectory after particle filtering we propose the use of a new #x201C;balanced bubble band smoother #x201D; allowing the trajectory to optimally match to both, map and recorded IMU data. This new approach makes it possible to do map matching online on a smart phone.},

Building an incremental map while also using it for localisation is of prime importance for mobile robot navigation but, until recently, has been confined to small-scale, mostly indoor, environments. The critical problems for large-scale implementations are as follows. First, data association--- finding correspondences between map landmarks and robot sensor measurements---becomes difficult in complex, cluttered environments, especially if the robot location is uncertain. Second, the information required to maintain a consistent map using traditional methods imposes a prohibitive computational burden as the map increases in size. And third, the mathematics for SLAM relies on assumptions of small errors and near-linearity, and these become invalid for larger maps.},

To significantly reduce the memory requirements of this approach (thereby allowing for the processing of large datasets) a novel map representation is also introduced that, instead of directly storing estimates of seabed depth, records the trajectory of each particle and synchronizes them to a common log of bathymetric observations. Upon detecting a loop closure each particle is then weighted by matching new observations to the current predictions generated from a local reconstruction of their map using GP Regression. Here the spatial correlation in the environment is fully exploited, allowing predictions of seabed depth to be generated in areas that may not have been directly observed previously. The particle resampling that is performed therefore not only enforces self-consistency in overlapping sections of the map but additionally enforces self-consistency between neighboring map borders. The results demonstrate how observations of seafloor structure with partial overlap can be used by bathymetric SLAM to improve map self consistency when compared to Dead Reckoning fused with Long-Baseline observations. In addition we show how mapping corrections can still be achieved even when no map overlap is present.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we propose an approach to SLAM suitable for bathymetric mapping by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). AUVs typically do not have access to GPS while underway and the survey areas of interest are unlikely to contain features that can easily be identified and tracked using bathymetric sonar. We demonstrate how the uncertainty in the vehicle state can be modeled using a particle filter and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), where each particle maintains a 2D depth map to model the seafloor. Efficient methods for maintaining and resampling the joint maps and particles using Distributed Particle Mapping are then described. Our algorithm was tested using field data collected by an AUV equipped with multibeam sonar. The results achieved by Bathymetric distributed Particle SLAM (BPSLAM) demonstrate how observations of the seafloor structure improve the estimated trajectory and resulting map when compared to dead reckoning fused with USBL observations, the best navigation solution during the trials. Furthermore, the computational run time to deliver these results falls well below the total mission time, providing the potential for the algorithm to be implemented in real time.},

  Abstract                 = {The performance of terrain-aided navigation of aircraft depends on the size of the terrain gradient in the area. The point-mass filter (PMF) described in this work yields an approximate Bayesian solution that is well suited for the unstructured nonlinear estimation problem in terrain navigation. It recursively propagates a density function of the aircraft position. The shape of the point-mass density reflects the estimate quality; this information is crucial in navigation applications, where estimates from different sources often are fused in a central filter. Monte Carlo simulations show that the approximation can reach the optimal performance, and realistic simulations show that the navigation performance is very high compared with other algorithms and that the point-mass filter solves the recursive estimation problem for all the types of terrain covered in the test. The main advantages of the PMF is that it works for many kinds of nonlinearities and many kinds of noise and prior distributions. The mesh support and resolution are automatically adjusted and controlled using a few intuitive design parameters. The main disadvantage is that it cannot solve estimation problems of very high dimension since the computational complexity of the algorithm increases drastically with the dimension of the state space. The implementation used in this work shows real-time performance for 2D and in some cases 3D models, but higher state dimensions are usually intractable},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a general purpose, representation independent method for the accurate and computationally efficient registration of 3-D shapes including free-form curves and surfaces. The method handles the full six-degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and experience shows that the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. For examples, a given 'model' shape and a sensed 'data' shape that represents a major portion of the model shape can be registered in minutes by testing one initial translation and a relatively small set of rotations to allow for the given level of model complexity. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model prior to shape inspection. The described method is also useful for deciding fundamental issues such as the congruence (shape equivalence) of different geometric representations as well as for estimating the motion between point sets where the correspondences are not known. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces.},

This unit consists of a barometric altimeter whose output is fused with topographic map information by a Kalman filter to provide robust information about the current vertical user position. These data replace the less reliable vertical position information provided the GPS device. It is shown that typical barometric errors like thermal divergences and fluctuations in the pressure due to changing weather conditions can be compensated by the topographic map information and the barometric error Kalman filter. The resulting height information is shown not only to be more reliable than height information provided by GPS. It also turns out that it leads to better attitude and thus better overall localization estimation accuracy due to the coupling of spatial orientations via the Direct Cosine Matrix. Results are presented both for artificially generated and field test data, where the user is moving by car.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a cascaded estimation algorithm for estimating all of the biases and states for full state feedback and dead reckoning of a farm tractor through short global positioning system (GPS) outages. First, a conventional (one stage) estimation scheme is presented. The single state estimation scheme is shown to have degraded performance in bias state estimation and dead-reckoning due to vehicle model errors. However, the states for position and velocity are not highly coupled to the tractor dynamic states, allowing for separation of the estimators. Therefore, the state estimation algorithms are divided into two cascaded estimators in order to prevent the errors in the vehicle model from corrupting the navigation states. A dead reckoning (or navigation) estimator estimates all of the inertial sensor biases while GPS is available. When GPS is not available, the dead reckoning estimator integrates rate measurements to provide position and heading estimates in order to maintain continuous control of the vehicle through these GPS outages. A second estimator is then used to estimate the additional states needed for full state feedback control algorithms. Bias estimates from the dead reckoning estimator are used to correct the sensor measurement used in the second estimator. An extended kalman filter (EKF) is utilized for each of the estimators. Results are given, showing that the cascaded estimation technique provides better estimation of the vehicle states over a conventional estimation scheme, especially during a GPS outage. Results are also given which verify the ability of the estimation algorithm to estimate all of the system biases and provide continuous control of the tractor through a short GPS outage},

  Abstract                 = {How often would investigators be misled if they took advantage of the likelihood principle and used likelihood ratiosâwhich need not be adjusted for multiple looks at the dataâto frequently examine accumulating data? The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is not often. As expected, the probability of observing misleading evidence does increase with each additional examination. However, the amount by which this probability increases converges to zero as the sample size grows. As a result, the probability of observing misleading evidence remains boundedâand therefore controllableâeven with an infinite number of looks at the data. Here we use boundary crossing results to detail how often misleading likelihood ratios arise in sequential designs. We find that the probability of observing a misleading likelihood ratio is often much less than its universal bound. Additionally, we find that in the presence of fixed-dimensional nuisance parameters, profile likelihoods are to be preferred over estimated likelihoods which result from replacing the nuisance parameters by their global maximum likelihood estimates.},

  Abstract                 = {For many problems in the field of tracking or even the wider area of filtering the a posteriori description of the uncertainty can oftentimes not be described by a simple Gaussian density function. In such situations the characterization of the uncertainty by a mean and a covariance does not capture the true extent of the uncertainty at hand. For example, when the posterior is multi-modal with well separated narrow modes. Such descriptions naturally occur in applications like target tracking with terrain constraints or tracking of closely spaced multiple objects, where one cannot keep track of the objects identities. In such situations a co-variance measure as a description of the uncertainty is not appropriate anymore. In this paper we look at the use of entropy as an uncertainty description. We show how to calculate the entropy based on a running particle filter. We will verify the particle based approximation of the entropy numerically. We we also discuss theoretical convergence properties and provide some motivating examples.},

In general, the accuracy of the mapping process depends directly on the accuracy of the localization process. This paper address the problem of maximizing the accuracy of the map building process during exploration by adaptively selecting control actions that maximize localisation accuracy. The map building and exploration task is modeled using an Occupancy Grid (OG) with concurrent localisation performed using a feature-based Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm. Adaptive sensing aims at maximizing the map information by simultaneously maximizing the expected Shannon information gain (Mutual Information) on the OG map and minimizing the uncertainty of the vehicle pose and map feature uncertainty in the SLAM process. The resulting map building system is demonstrated in an indoor environment using data from a laser scanner mounted on a mobile platform.},

The algorithm is capable of maintaing accurate state estimates during aggressive flight in unstructured 3D environments without the use of an external positioning system. Our localization algorithm is based on an extension of the Gaussian Particle Filter. We partition the state according to measurement independence relationships and then calculate a pseudo-linear update which allows us to use 20x fewer particles than a naive implementation to achieve similar accuracy in the state estimate. We also propose a multi-step forward fitting method to identify the noise parameters of the IMU and compare results with and without accurate position measurements. Our process and measurement models integrate naturally with an exponential coordinates representation of the attitude uncertainty. We demonstrate our algorithms experimentally on a fixed-wing vehicle flying in a challenging indoor environment.},

To illustrate this fact they showed that a general model that assumes that overt responses representing (perfectly calibrated) true judgments perturbed by random error can replicate typical patterns observed in empirical studies. In this paper we provide a method for determining whether apparent overconfidence in empirical data reflects a systematic bias in judgment or is an artifact due solely to the presence of error. The approach is based, in part, on the Wallsten and González-Vallejo (1994) Stochastic Judgment Model (SJM). The new method is described in detail and is used to analyze results from a new study. The analysis indicates a clear overconfidence effect, above and beyond the level predicted by a model assuming perfect calibration perturbed by random error. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

In order to increase the bottom-followers reliability, the paper discusses possible techniques for modeling and handling the environmental and measurement uncertainty in the estimate of the local interactions between the vehicle and the operating environment, i.e. altitude and bottom slope. In particular, according to at-sea operational experience, the problem of managing dropouts due to erroneous tracking of multi-path echoes by the ROV altimeter(s) is addressed.

Simultaneous translation and rotation are accurately measured, and the camera need not be placed at the robot #8217;s center of rotation. The algorithm is straightforward to implement and robust to noisy measurements. The software is based on open source computer vision libraries and is itself open source. It has been tested in a wide variety of real-world environments and on several different mobile robot platforms.},

The grazing angle correction is particularly effective when applied to multibeam sonar sidescan for which high-resolution co-registered bathymetry is available.

  Abstract                 = {Current rover localization techniques such as visual odometry have proven to be very effective on short to medium-length traverses (e.g., up to a few kilometres). This paper deals with the problem of long-range rover localization (e.g., 10km and up). An autonomous method to globally localize a rover is proposed by matching features detected from a 3D orbital elevation map and rover-based 3D lidar scans. The accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm is enhanced with visual odometry, and inclinometer/sun-sensor orientation measurements. The methodology was tested with real data, including 37 lidar scans of terrain from a Mars-Moon analogue site on Devon Island, Nunavut. When a scan contained a sufficient number of good topographic features, localization produced position errors of no more than 100m, and as low as a few metres in many cases. On a 10km traverse, the developed algorithm's localization estimates were shown to significantly outperform visual odometry estimates. It is believed that this architecture could be used to accurately and autonomously localize a rover on long-range traverses.},

We propose a family of efficient particle filters, for both synchronous and asynchronous sensor observations as well as for important special cases. Moreover, we discuss connections with previous works.

  Abstract                 = {Terrain Based Navigation (TBN) is a method rooted to the early cruise missile navigation systems, when GPS was not yet available. For decades, TBN has been applied as a complementary system to INS navigation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). In the field of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), it has the potential to bound the drift inherent to dead reckoning navigation, based on INS and/or Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) sensors, as well as to make the navigation beyond the areas of coverture of the acoustic transponder networks, a reality. This paper overviews the main concepts related to TBN and present an exhaustive survey of the works reported in the literature. As a main contribution, a table comparing the motion and the measurement models, as well as the probabilistic framework used for the estimation is reported. An effort has been put on unifying the diverse nomenclature used across the surveyed works. We aim this paper to become an starting point for the researchers interested in this technology, with pointers to the most interested works in the area.},

We seek hypotheses that can justify a separate implementation of control, localization and planning. In the end, we reduce the stochastic control problem to path- planning in the extended space of poses x covariances; the transitions between states are modeled through the use of the Fisher information matrix. In this framework, we consider two problems: minimizing the execution time, and minimizing the final covariance, with an upper bound on the execution time. Two correct and complete algorithms are presented. The first is the direct extension of classical graph-search algorithms in the extended space. The second one is a back-projection algorithm: uncertainty constraints are propagated backward from the goal towards the start state.},

We present a modification for making the multivariate normal likelihood acclimatize itself to general correlated data. The modified likelihood is asymptotically legitimate for any true underlying joint distributions so long as they have finite second moments. One can, hence, acquire full likelihood inference without knowing the true random mechanisms underlying the data. Simulations and real data analysis are provided to demonstrate the merit of our proposed parametric robust method. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new method for simultaneous localization and mapping that exploits the topology of the robot's free space to localize the robot on a partially constructed map. The topology of the environment is encoded in a topological map; the particular topological map used in this paper is the generalized Voronoi graph (GVG), which also encodes some metric information about the robot's environment, as well. In this paper, we present the low-level control laws that generate the GVG edges and nodes, thereby allowing for exploration of an unknown space. With these prescribed control laws, the GVG can be viewed as an arbitrator for a hybrid control system that determines when to invoke a particular low-level controller from a set of controllers all working toward the high-level capability of mobile robot exploration. The main contribution, however, is using the graph structure of the GVG, via a graph matching process, to localize the robot. Experimental results verify the described work},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines the effect of scale (exhibited by spatial sampling) in modeling mean slope from lidar data using two representations of scale: lidar posting density (i.e. post-spacing) and DEM resolution (i.e. cell size). The study areas selected include six small (i.e. approximately 3 km2) urban drainage basins in Richland County, SC, USA, which share similar hydrologic characteristics. This research spatially sampled an airborne lidar dataset collected in 2000 at a 2m nominal posting density to simulate lidar posting density at various postspacings, from 2m through 10 m. DEMs were created from the lidar observations at a corresponding cell size using spatial interpolation. Finally, using these DEMs, a sensitivity analysis between modeled terrain slope and lidar postspacing was conducted. Results of the sensitivity analyses showed that the deviation between mean slope and modeled mean slope decreases with finer posting density and DEM resolution. The relationship of mean slope with varying cell sizes and post-spacing suggests a linear and a logarithmic function, respectively, for all study areas. More importantly, cell size has a greater effect on mean slope than lidar posting density. Implications of these results for lumped hydrologic modeling are then postulated.},

  Abstract                 = {The covariance and variogram models (ordinary or generalized) are important statistical tools used in various estimation and simulation techniques which have been recently applied to diverse hydrologic problems. For example, the efficacy of kriging, a method for interpolating, filtering, or averaging spatial phenomena, depends, to a large extent, on the covariance or variogram model chosen. The aim of this article is to provide the users of these techniques with convenient criteria that may help them to judge whether a function which arises in a particular problem, and is not included among the known covariance or variogram models, is permissible as such a model. This is done by investigating the properties of the candidate model in both the space and frequency domains. In the present article this investigation covers stationary random functions as well as intrinsic random functions (i.e., nonstationary functions for which increments of some order are stationary). Then, based on the theoretical results obtained, a procedure is outlined and successfully applied to a number of candidate models. In order to give to this procedure a more practical context, we employ stereological equations that essentially transfer the investigations to one-dimensional space, together with approximations in terms of polygonal functions and Fourier-Bessel series expansions. There are many benefits and applications of such a procedure. Polygonal models can be fit arbitrarily closely to the data. Also, the approximation of a particular model in the frequency domain by a Fourier-Bessel series expansion can be very effective. This is shown by theory and by example.},

The method is applied to estimating the position of a road vehicle along a one-mile test track and 7 kilometer span of a highway using terrain-based localization where the pitch response of the vehicle is compared to a pre-measured pitch map of each roadway. The results indicate that the method can be used to decrease the computational load of the algorithm while maintaining the accuracy of the Particle Filter, but that the challenge is to determine the appropriate moment to perform the switch between algorithms. A modified Chi-Squared test is used to determine a switchover point when the probability density function of the particle population can be approximated by a Gaussian for initializing the Unscented Kalman Filter. A normalized innovation squared test is also demonstrated to be useful for monitoring the health of the Unscented Kalman Filter.},

  Abstract                 = {Terrain-Relative Navigation (TRN) is an emerging technique for localizing a vehicle in underwater environments. TRN offers a means of augmenting an INS/DVL dead-reckoned solution with continuous position fixes based on correlations with pre-stored bathymetry maps instead of surfacing for periodic GPS fixes. TRN accuracy on the order of 3m has been demonstrated in recent field trials using MBARIs Dorado-class AUVs in Monterey Bay. However, these TRN algorithms have occasionally converged to incorrect solutions when the AUV operates for extended times over featureless terrain. Specifically, the TRN filter can become overconfident in an incorrect position fix. This paper demonstrates that the cause of these false fixes in information-poor regions is an incorrect accounting of map uncertainty and sensor noise in standard TRN filter implementations, and offers a modification to the algorithms that can eliminate the false-fixes. Specifically, standard TRN algorithms assume that map noise and vehicle sensor noise can be lumped together when performing measurement updates. In regions where the ratio of terrain information to map error is low, this assumption leads to underestimation of position uncertainty as the filter essentially converges on noise in the map. Adjusting the filter variance to depend on the estimated terrain information in addition to map error and sensor error provides a more robust TRN solution. An improved algorithm is described which adjusts the filter variance using a technique employed by the robotics and statistics community for reducing the likelihood of overconfidence. The advantage of this adjusted variance technique is that it permits nominal convergence rates of the TRN filter over informationrich terrain while mitigating the risk of false fixes in informationpoor terrain. The effectiveness of the modified TRN algorithm is demonstrated in simulations using field data from MBARI AUV runs over flat terrain in Monterey Bay.;},

Although a number of SLAM implementations have appeared in the literature, the need to maintain the knowledge of the relative relationships between all the landmark location estimates contained in the map makes SLAM computationally intractable in implementations containing more than few tens of landmarks. In this paper, the theoretical basis and a practical implementation of a computationally efficient solution to SLAM is presented. The paper shows that it is indeed possible to remove a large percentage of the landmarks from the map without making the map-building process statistically inconsistent. Furthermore, it is shown that the efficiency of the SLAM can be maintained by judicious selection of landmarks, to be preserved in the map, based on their information content},

The algorithm exploits nonholonomic constraints that govern the motion of a vehicle on a surface to obtain velocity observation measurements which aid in the estimation of the alignment of the IMU as well as the forward velocity of the vehicle. It is shown that this can be achieved without any external sensing provided that certain observability conditions are met. A theoretical analysis is provided together with a comparison of experimental results between a nonlinear implementation of the algorithm and an IMU/GPS navigation system. This comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm. The real time implementation is also addressed through a multiple observation inertial aiding algorithm based on the information filter. The results show that the use of these constraints and vehicle speed guarantees the observability of the velocity and the attitude of the inertial unit, and hence bounds the errors associated with these states. The strategies proposed provides a tighter navigation loop which can sustain outages of GPS for a greater amount of time as compared to when the inertial unit is used with standard integration algorithms},

Starting from estimation-theoretic foundations of this problem, the paper proves that a solution to the SLAM problem is indeed possible. The underlying structure of the SLAM problem is first elucidated. A proof that the estimated map converges monotonically to a relative map with zero uncertainty is then developed. It is then shown that the absolute accuracy of the map and the vehicle location reach a lower bound defined only by the initial vehicle uncertainty. Together, these results show that it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and, using relative observations only, incrementally build a perfect map of the world and to compute simultaneously a bounded estimate of vehicle location. The paper also describes a substantial implementation of the SLAM algorithm on a vehicle operating in an outdoor environment using millimeter-wave radar to provide relative map observations. This implementation is used to demonstrate how some key issues such as map management and data association can be handled in a practical environment. The results obtained are cross-compared with absolute locations of the map landmarks obtained by surveying.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents comprehensive testing and analysis of a particle filter (PF) framework for real-time terrain navigation on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The goal is to obtain georeferenced localization for an AUV navigation system using reference bathymetry maps and bathymetric measurements in lieu of Global Positioning System (GPS) updates or acoustic localization methods such as long baseline (LBL). The algorithms are tested using navigation and sensor data collected during a long-distance run of the midsize autonomous reconfigurable vehicle (MARV) AUV, during which the Inertial Navigation System (INS) accumulated significant horizontal position error ( gt;;100 m). Run data sets over areas of both high and low bathymetric relief are used to compare performance with different altitude sensors, including multibeam and single-beam sonar, and four-beam Doppler velocity logger (DVL) sonar. A comparison of established techniques for dealing with tide levels is also presented. The technique of adding a third dimension to the PF state vector to compensate for changing water levels allowed the estimator to work consistently in areas of low bathymetric relief, where relative terrain profiling methods broke down and even slight errors in tide prediction models otherwise caused significant position errors. The effects of decreased vertical resolution and accuracy of the reference map is also investigated. To address problems of insufficient sample size, a novel PF resampling technique is presented in which jittering noise added to duplicate samples is scaled based on the particle cloud volume. This technique allows the PF to consistently recover a position fix over a search area of several kilometers without needing to significantly increase the number of particles used.},

This paper describes applied research into addressing this challenge through the development of a Monte Carlo Localization (MCL), or particle filter framework. The goal is to supplement an AUV navigation system with independent position fixes based on environmental observations. A particle filter framework for bathymetric terrain navigation is developed and tested using real in-water vehicle and sensor data collected with NUWCs 12 #x00BE;" Mid-Size Autonomous Reconfigurable Vehicle (MARV) AUV. The results illustrate how this technique can be successfully applied to allow an AUV to recover from significant position uncertainty and errors during a mission.

  Abstract                 = {Model misspecification has been a major concern in practical model based image analysis. The underlying assumptions of generative processes usually can not exactly describe real-world data samples, which renders the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and the Bayesian decision methods unreliable. In this work we study a robust adjusted likelihood (RAL) function that can improve image classification performance under misspecified models. The RAL is calculated by raising the conventional likelihood function to a positive power and multiplying it with a scaling factor. Similar to model parameter estimation, these two new RAL parameters, i.e. the power and the scaling factor, are estimated from the training data using minimum error rate method. In two-category classification case, this RAL is equivalent to a linear discriminant function in log-likelihood space. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this RAL, we first simulate a model misspecification scenario, in which two Rayleigh sources are misspecified as Gaussian distributions. The Gaussian parameters and the RAL parameters are estimated accordingly from the training data, and the two RAL parameters are studied separately. The simulation results show that the Bayes decisions based on maximum-RAL yield higher classification accuracy than the decisions based on conventional maximum-likelihood. We further apply the RAL in automatic target recognition (ATR) of SAR images. Two target classes, i.e. t72 and bmp2, from MSTAR SAR target dataset are used in this study. The target signatures are modeled using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) with five mixtures for each class. Image classification results again demonstrate a clear advantage of the proposed approach.},

This results in a nonlinear estimation problem. For automotive tracking systems, these problems are traditionally handled using the extended Kalman filter. In this paper we describe the application of the marginalized particle filter to this problem. Studies using both synthetic and authentic data show that the marginalized particle filter can in fact give better performance than the extended Kalman filter.

  Abstract                 = {A sonar-based mapping and navigation system developed for an autonomous mobile robot operating in unknown and unstructured environments is described. The system uses sonar range data to build a multileveled description of the robot's surroundings. Sonar readings are interpreted using probability profiles to determine empty and occupied areas. Range measurements from multiple points of view are integrated into a sensor-level sonar map, using a robust method that combines the sensor information in such a way as to cope with uncertainties and errors in the data. The resulting two-dimensional maps are used for path planning and navigation. From these sonar maps, multiple representations are developed for various kinds of problem-solving activities. Several dimensions of representation are defined: the abstraction axis, the geographical axis, and the resolution axis. The sonar mapping procedures have been implemented as part of an autonomous mobile robot navigation system called Dolphin. The major modules of this system are described and related to the various mapping representations used. Results from actual runs are presented, and further research is mentioned. The system is also situated within the wider context of developing an advanced software architecture for autonomous mobile robots.},

  Abstract                 = {An essential key capability for a mobile robot to perform autonomous navigation is the ability to localize itself in its environment. The most basic way to perform localization is dead-reckoning, i. e., to use relative measuring sensors of the robot like odometry (wheel encoders) by incrementally incorporating the measured revolutions of the robots wheels from a known starting position. As these sensors only deliver relative measurements and all sensors are subjected to noise, the uncertainty of the pose grows boundlessly over the covered distance. In outdoor environments navigation sensors like GPS and compass are a viable option. They are measuring absolute quantities and therefore are not suffering from error accumulation but are prone to local disturbances by surrounding objects. The measurements of the compass are degraded by disturbances of the terrestrial magnetic field, e. g., by metal fences or ventilation fans of air condition systems. Using a low-cost differential GPS receiver, the significant remaining source of error is multipath propagation due to reflections and shadowing effects of large objects like buildings. As the reflections are dependent on the constellation of the receiver and the satellites relative to nearby reflecting surfaces the errors are time variant and locally varying. For precise self localization the combination of several sensors is essential as due to the noisy measurements no single sensor is sufficient. The data from the sensors is fused to a combined estimate resulting in a more accurate localization. A new Kalman filter based approach will be presented to perform multi-sensor fusion for on-line localization under realtime constraints. While for indoor applications of mobile robots a 2D localization usually is sufficient, as the robot typically operates on flat floors, a full 6 DoF estimation of position and attitude is necessary in outdoor environments where the assumption of a flat ground cannot be applied. To accomplish the - - 6 DoF estimation relative measuring sensors and absolute measuring sensors are combined by means of multi-sensor fusion. The fusion combines the advantages of the relative measuring sensors regarding their local precision with the capability of absolute sensors to confine the global uncertainty and thus preventing unbounded error growth.},

  Abstract                 = {Without some form of correction, an inertial navigation system's (INS's) positional error grows without bound over time. Several techniques have been used to reduce the INS's positional error. One of these techniques, terrainaided navigation (TAN), has been widely researched over the last several decades with the research focusing on two methods: Sandia inertial terrain-aided navigation (SITAN), which is based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and terrain contour matching, which is based on correlation techniques. These methods are applied most successfully to fixed-wing aircraft flying over specific types of terrain; they perform poorly for low-velocity, highly maneuverable aircraft such as helicopters, especially when flying over flat or very rough terrain. In this paper, we introduce VATAN, a new TAN method based on the Viterbi algorithm (VA), and compare its performance to an implementation of SITAN based on a single EKF. Simulation results show that the VA in VATAN overcomes divergence problems associated with the EKF in SITAN and provides position estimates with smaller averagesquared error. These results show that VATAN has the potential to provide good performance for low-velocity aircraft flying over all types of terrain.},

Depending on the application at hand, a different algorithm is selected to generate a motion plan. Nevertheless, they all have the fundamental characteristics of the rough terrain in common. Based on this notion, a unifying formalism is presented which can be used to represent application-dependent properties of the terrain to the motion planner. The approach is based on the characteristic difficulty associated with each configuration of the robot on the rough terrain. This concept is formalised resulting in the definition of "obstacleness" as generic degree of presence of an obstacle. A novel rough-terrain motion planning algorithm is presented which makes use of the obstacleness measure. The approach is based on a bi-directional rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm. The exploration of configuration space by the RRTs is biased towards regions of low navigational difficulty to compute trajectories in easily traversable terrain. Preliminary test results obtained with a fictional planetary rover in a rigid body dynamics simulation are also presented},

It has three main steps: (i) estimation of the gradient energy map (edges) and detection of the cloudless (reliable) areas; (ii) initialization of the contour positions; (iii) obtaining the transformation parameters (affine model) by means of a global contour optimization approach. Three different algorithms are proposed for optimization. The performance of the overall technique is assessed using AVHRR and multisensor AVHRR-SeaWiFS imagery },

To do this, we use the discrepancy between vehicle-derived vs. ship-derived acoustic bathymetry as a corrective error measure in a standard nonlinear optimization framework. The advantage of this re-navigation methodology is that it exploits existing ship-derived bathymetric maps to improve vehicle navigation without requiring additional infrastructure.

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a system for reacquiring features of interest in a shallow-water ocean environment, using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with low-cost sonar and navigation sensors. In performing mine countermeasures, it is critical to enable AUVs to navigate accurately to previously mapped objects of interest in the water column or on the seabed, for further assessment or remediation. An important aspect of the overall system design is to keep the size and cost of the reacquisition vehicle as low as possible, as it may potentially be destroyed in the reacquisition mission. This low-cost requirement prevents the use of sophisticated AUV navigation sensors, such as a Doppler velocity log (DVL) or an inertial navigation system (INS). Our system instead uses the Proviewer 900-kHz imaging sonar from Blueview Technologies, which produces forward-looking sonar (FLS) images at ranges up to 40 mat approximately 4 Hz. In large volumes, it is hoped that this sensor can be manufactured at low cost. Our approach uses a novel simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm that detects and tracks features in the FLS images to renavigate to a previously mapped target. This feature-based navigation (FBN) system incorporates a number of recent advances in pose graph optimization algorithms for SLAM. The system has undergone extensive field testing over a period of more than four years, demonstrating the potential for the use of this new approach for feature reacquisition. In this report, we review the methodologies and components of the FBN system, describe the system's technological features, review the performance of the system in a series of extensive in-water field tests, and highlight issues for future research.},

Accuracy of the maps and the robot locations computed using SLAM is strongly dependent on the characteristics of the environment, for example feature density, as well as the speed and direction of motion of the robot. Appropriate control of the robot motion is particularly important in bearing-only SLAM, where the information from a moving sensor is essential. In this paper a near minimum time path planning algorithm with a finite planning horizon is proposed for bearing-only SLAM. The objective of the algorithm is to achieve a predefined mapping precision while maintaining acceptable vehicle location uncertainty in the minimum time. Simulation results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The presented method is used to determine a path allowing the AUV to pass its sensors over all points of the target structure, which is known as coverage path planning. Our profile following method goes beyond traditional seabed following at a safe altitude and exploits hovering capabilities of recent AUV developments. A range sonar is used to incrementally construct a local probabilistic map representation of the environment and estimates of the local profile are obtained via linear regression. Two behavior-based controllers use these estimates to perform horizontal and vertical profile following. We build upon these tools to address coverage path planning for 3D underwater structures using a (potentially inaccurate) prior map and following cross-section profiles of the target structure. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated using the GIRONA 500 AUV both in simulation using synthetic and real-world bathymetric data and in pool trials.},

Understanding the interoperability and integration of the Chinese Compass with the current GNSS, namely the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS), the European Galileo, and the Russian GLONASS, requires knowing and understanding its signal structures-specifically its pseudorandom noise (PRN) codes and code structures. Moreover, the knowledge of the code is a prerequisite for designing receivers capable of acquiring and tracking the satellite. More important is determining if the signal may degrade performance of the current GNSS in the form of interference. Finally, we are eager to learn from the code and signal design of our Chinese colleagues. For this research, we set up a 1.8-m dish antenna to collect the broadcast Compass-M1 signals. Even with the dish antenna, the received signal is still weak and buried in thermal noise. We then apply signal processing and are able to extract the PRN code chips out of the noise in all three frequency bands. The PRN codes are thousands of bits long. In addition, we find that the Compass-M1 PRN codes in all frequency bands are Gold codes. We also derive the Gold code generators to represents thousands of code chips with fewer than a hundred bits. Finally, we implement these codes in our software receiver to verify and validate our analysis.},

Depending on the grade of the sensor, when used alone, inertial data for control and navigation will only be reliable for a matter of seconds or minutes. An algorithm is presented that simultaneously estimates relative feature location in sensor space and inertial position, velocity and attitude in world coordinates. Feature locations are maintained in sensor space to ensure measurement linearity. Image depth is represented by an inverse function which permits un-delayed feature initialization and improves linearity and convergence. It is shown that the resulting navigation solution is able to be constrained, providing results comparable to inertial-GPS systems. Results are presented for an autonomous aircraft operating in a large semi-structured environment.},

In all circumstances, to date, these expeditions have led to discovery of at least one new hydrothermal field at the seafloor - in the Lau Basin and on the equatorial East Pacific Rise, southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge and SW Indian Ridge, on very fast-, fast-, slow- and ultraslow-spreading ridges, respectively. Our method requires three stages of deployment which, to date, have always been conducted with the aid of combined LBL/DVL navigation. First: in situ sensor mapping of the water column is carried out in plan-view (along constant depth surfaces) to locate the core of a dispersing hydrothermal plume; Second: high-resolution bathymetric mapping of the underlying seafloor is carried out along grid-lines sufficiently close-spaced to ensure interception of rising buoyant plumes (also detected by in situ sensors); Third: photo-reconnaissance, 5 m above the seafloor, over areas of active venting and associated biological communities. This approach has already proven effective for first order exploration for (e.g.) the Census of Marine Life but improvements sought for the future include vehicle endurance and survey speed, improved in situ sensor payloads, ldquodecision-makingrdquo autonomy at the seafloor and introduction of sampling capability (e.g. via the Nereus H-ROV).},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a three-phase use of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Autonomous Benthic Explorer (ABE), to locate, map and photograph previously undiscovered fields of high temperature submarine hydrothermal vents. Our approach represents both a complement to and a significant advance beyond the prior state of the art. Previously, hydrothermal exploration relied upon deep-tow instruments equipped with sensors that could locate sites of active black smoker venting to within a few kilometers. Follow-on CTD tow-yos could then resolve the sites of seafloor venting to length scales of less than a kilometer but rarely to better than a few hundreds of meters. In our new approach ABE: (i) uses sensors to locate the center of a dispersing non-buoyant hydrothermal plume 100400&#xa0;m above the seabed; (ii) makes high-resolution maps of the seafloor beneath the plume center whilst simultaneously detecting interception of any rising, buoyant hydrothermal plumes; and (iii) dives to the seafloor to take photographs in and around any new vent site to characterize its geologic setting and reveal the nature of any chemosynthetic ecosystems it may host. By conducting all of the above under long-baseline navigation, precise sites of venting can be determined to within 5&#xa0;m. Our approach can be used both to address important scientific issues in their own right and to ensure much more efficient use of other deep-submergence assets such as human occupied vehicles (HOVs) and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) during follow-on studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Building a model of the environment is essential for mobile robotics. It allows the robot to reason about its surroundings and plan actions according to its intentions. To enable safe motion planning it is vital to anticipate object movements. This paper presents an improved formulation for occupancy filtering. Our approach is closely related to the Bayesian Occupancy Filter (BOF) presented in. The basic idea of occupancy filters is to represent the environment as a 2-dimensional grid of cells holding information about their state of occupancy and velocity. To improve the accuracy of predictions, prior knowledge about the motion preferences is used, derived from map data that can be obtained from navigation systems. In combination with a physically accurate transition model, it is possible to estimate the environment dynamics. Experiments show that this yields reliable estimates even for occluded regions.},

The distribution of rocks >1.5 m diameter visible in rare boulder fields also follows this steep decrease with increasing diameter. The effective thermal inertia of rock populations calculated from a simple empirical model of the effective inertia of rocks versus diameter shows that most natural rock populations have cumulative effective thermal inertias of 17002100 J m?2 s?0.5 K?1 and are consistent with the model rock distributions applied to total rock abundance estimates. The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) airbags have been successfully tested against extreme rock distributions with a higher percentage of potentially hazardous triangular buried rocks than observed at the Pathfinder and Viking landing sites. The probability of the lander impacting a >1 m diameter rock in the first 2 bounces is <3% and <5% for the Meridiani and Gusev landing sites, respectively, and is <0.14% and <0.03% for rocks >1.5 m and >2 m diameter, respectively. Finally, the model rock size-frequency distributions indicate that rocks >0.1 m and >0.3 m in diameter, large enough to place contact sensor instruments against and abrade, respectively, should be plentiful within a single sol's drive at the Meridiani and Gusev landing sites.},

In this paper, we propose a unified approach to forensic speaker recognition (FSR) oriented to fulfil these admissibility requirements within a framework which is transparent, testable, and understandable, both for scientists and fact-finders. We show how the evaluation of DNA evidence, which is based on a probabilistic similarity-typicality metric in the form of likelihood ratios (LR), can also be generalized to continuous LR estimation, thus providing a common framework for phonetic-linguistic methods and automatic systems. We highlight the importance of calibration, and we exemplify with LRs from diphthongal F-pattern, and LRs in NIST-SRE06 tasks. The application of the proposed approach in daily casework remains a sensitive issue, and special caution is enjoined. Our objective is to show how traditional and automatic FSR methodologies can be transparent and testable, but simultaneously remain conscious of the present limitations. We conclude with a discussion on the combined use of traditional and automatic approaches and current challenges for the admissibility of speech evidence.},

However, the knowledge required to jam GPS is becoming public and the hardware to achieve this is basic. When GPS data are unavailable and a low grade INS is used, navigation accuracy quickly degrades to an unacceptable level. The addition of one or more terrain referenced navigation (TRN) systems to an integrated INS&sol;GPS navigation system enables the INS to be calibrated during GPS outages, increasing the robustness of the overall navigation solution. TRN techniques are compared and integration architectures are reviewed. For the initial studies of INS&sol;GPS&sol;TRN integration, radar altimeter based terrain contour navigation (TCN) with a batch processing algorithm is used in conjunction with a centralised integration filter. Four different approaches for using these TCN fixes to calibrate the INS are compared. These are a best fix method, a weighted fix method using a probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) and single and multi-hypothesis versions of the Iterative Gaussian Mixture Approximation of the Posterior (IGMAP) method. Simulation results are presented showing that the single hypothesis IGMAP technique offers the best balance between accuracy, robustness and processing efficiency.},

The various tools of least squares estimation can be favourably utilized for the assessment of the correlation quality. Furthermore, the system allows for stabilization and improvement of the correlation procedure through the simultaneous consideration of geometrical constraints, e.g. the collinearity condition. Some exciting new perspectives are emphasized, as for example multiphoto correlation, multitemporal and multisensor correlation, multipoint correlation, and simultaneous correlation/triangulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Bayesian hierarchical models typically involve specifying prior distributions for one or more variance components. This is rather removed from the observed data, so specification based on expert knowledge can be difficult. While there are suggestions for "default" priors in the literature, often a conditionally conjugate inverse-gamma specification is used, despite documented drawbacks of this choice. The authors suggest "conservative" prior distributions for variance components, which deliberately give more weight to smaller values. These are appropriate for investigators who are skeptical about the presence of variability in the second-stage parameters (random effects) and want to particularly guard against inferring more structure than is really present. The suggested priors readily adapt to various hierarchical modelling settings, such as fitting smooth curves, modelling spatial variation and combining data from multiple sites. /// Les modèles bayésiens hiérarchiques comportent généralement une ou des composantes de variance que l'on doit doter de lois a priori. Le choix de ces lois est délicat car la variation est un aspect des données difficile à cerner. De toutes les lois a priori "par défaut," une loi conjuguée inverse-gamma conditionnelle est la plus souvent employée, malgré ses inconvénients. Les auteurs proposent des lois a priori "conservatrices" pour les composantes de la variance qui privilégient les petites valeurs. Elles conviennent bien aux situations où le chercheur s'interroge sur la présence réelle de variabilité dans les paramètres de deuxième degré (effets aléatoires) et qu'il veut éviter d'imposer une structure artificielle. Les lois a priori suggérées s'adaptent à diverses situations propices à la modélisation hiérarchique, notamment l'ajustement de courbes lisses et la modélisation de variation spatiale ou de données issues de nombreux sites.},

This tutorial serves two purposes: to survey the part of the theory that is most important for applications and to survey a number of illustrative positioning applications from which conclusions relevant for the theory can be drawn. The theory part first surveys the nonlinear filtering problem and then describes the general PF algorithm in relation to classical solutions based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the point mass filter (PMF). Tuning options, design alternatives, and user guidelines are described, and potential computational bottlenecks are identified and remedies suggested. Finally, the marginalized (or Rao-Blackwellized) PF is overviewed as a general framework for applying the PF to complex systems. The application part is more or less a stand-alone tutorial without equations that does not require any background knowledge in statistics or nonlinear filtering. It describes a number of related positioning applications where geographical information systems provide a nonlinear measurement and where it should be obvious that classical approaches based on Kalman filters (KFs) would have poor performance. All applications are based on real data and several of them come from real-time implementations. This part also provides complete code examples.},

It consists of a class of motion models and a general nonlinear measurement equation in position. A general algorithm is presented, which is parsimonious with the particle dimension. It is based on marginalization, enabling a Kalman filter to estimate all position derivatives, and the particle filter becomes low dimensional. This is of utmost importance for high-performance real-time applications. Automotive and airborne applications illustrate numerically the advantage over classical Kalman filter-based algorithms. Here, the use of nonlinear models and non-Gaussian noise is the main explanation for the improvement in accuracy. More specifically, we describe how the technique of map matching is used to match an aircraft's elevation profile to a digital elevation map and a car's horizontal driven path to a street map. In both cases, real-time implementations are available, and tests have shown that the accuracy in both cases is comparable with satellite navigation (as GPS) but with higher integrity. Based on simulations, we also argue how the particle filter can be used for positioning based on cellular phone measurements, for integrated navigation in aircraft, and for target tracking in aircraft and cars. Finally, the particle filter enables a promising solution to the combined task of navigation and tracking, with possible application to airborne hunting and collision avoidance systems in cars},

For deep water applications or operations requiring a high degree of covertness, surfacing for GPS is not a solution. The conventional submerged position update techniques, like DGPS-USBL or LBL, requires external physical infrastructure in the operation area of the vehicle. Terrain referenced navigation is a promising technique for submerged position updates. It requires only a bathymetric map of the operation area and the use of a bathymetric sensor during the operation. Different algorithms for terrain referenced navigation have already successfully been tested for underwater applications. These algorithms include variants of the original TERCOM, different Kalman filter based techniques and non-linear Bayesian estimators like the point mass filter and particle filters. To asses the performance of the different algorithms and their robustness on both real and simulated data, FFI has developed a tool called TerrLab. The tool was originally used to qualify algorithms for the real-time terrain navigation system for the HUGIN AUVs. It is now also used to test different sensor and DTM error models for the algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Terrain navigation in the presence of an unknown tide level has been demonstrated earlier, where both horizontal position and depth errors of a nominal navigation solution can be estimated concurrently. Accurate bathymetric measurements based on acoustic sensors also rely on knowing the sound speed near the sensor and in the water column between the sensor and the sea floor. This is important for vessels operating far from the sea floor, but also for underwater vehicles operating near the sea floor with side-looking bathymetric systems. To enable high performance terrain navigation in those scenarios, the sound speed error must also be considered. This paper proposes three different modifications to a 2D point mass filter to enable concurrent compensation for tide and sound speed error. Simulations so far indicate a great improvement compared to using a regular 2D point mass filter.},

However, the actual autonomy of these vehicles is limited in many ways, restricting their potential uses. Further advances in AUV autonomy will enable new operations, such as very long endurance missions (weeks), and operations in unknown areas. While some experimentation is already taking place with e.g. under ice operations, the chance of failure is unacceptably high for many potential users. De-risking of long- endurance autonomous operations in unknown areas is thus an important goal for the AUV community.

This paper presents a novel algorithm that combines Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering and scan matching. In our approach scan matching is used for minimizing odometric errors during mapping. A probabilistic model of the residual errors of scan matching process is then used for the resampling steps. This way the number of samples required is seriously reduced. Simultaneously we reduce the particle depletion problem that typically prevents the robot from closing large loops. We present extensive experiments that illustrate the superior performance of our approach compared to previous approaches.},

The method removes the AUVs inertial position from the equations, allowing the mission to be completed without ship-based navigation aids. This is a substantial operational advantage. Additionally, it differs from [1] in that it treats each sonar return individually, instead of abstracting multiple readings to a single point, removing a potential source of bias. Finally it reformulates the problem to simplify greatly the estimation optimization by reducing the number of needed estimation parameters. Together, these changes yield speed increases of roughly three orders of magnitude, with no loss in accuracy. The method is demonstrated via full simulation of an AUV operating around a free drifting iceberg. Additionally, an underwater sea cliff in Monterey Canyon is used as an iceberg surrogate to test the method on field data.},

  Abstract                 = {As part of a countywide large-scale mapping effort for Richland County, South Carolina, an accuracy assessment of a recently acquired lidar-derived data set was conducted. Airborne lidar (2-m nominal posting) was collected at a flying height of 1207 meters above ground level (AGL) using an Optech ALTM (Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper) 1210 system. Unique to this study are the reference point elevations. Rather than using an interpolation approach for gathering observed elevations at reference points, the x-y coordinates of lidar points were located in the field and these elevations were surveyed. Using both total-station-based and rapid-static GPS techniques, observed vertical heights were measured at each reference lidar posting. The variability of vertical accuracy was evaluated for six land-cover categories. Root-meansquared error (RMSE) values ranged from a low of 17 to 19 cm (pavement, low grass, and evergreen forests) to a high of 26 cm (deciduous forests). The unique error assessment of lidar postings also allowed for the creation of an error budget model. The observed lidar elevation error was decomposed into errors from lidar system measurements, horizontal displacement, interpolation error, and surveyor error. A crossvalidation approach was used to assess the observed interpolated lidar elevation error for each field-verified reference point. In order of decreasing importance, the lidar system measurements were the dominant source of error followed by interpolation error, horizontal displacement error, and surveyor error. Observed elevation error in steeper slopes (e.g., 25°) was estimated to be twice as large as those on low slopes (e.g., 1.5°).},

Given a particular configuration of sensors, this technique exploits the structure of the probability distributions of the target state and of the sensor measurements to control the mobile sensors such that future observations minimize the expected future uncertainty of the target state. The mutual information between the sensors and the target state is computed using a particle filter representation of the posterior probability distribution, making it possible to directly use nonlinear and non-Gaussian target state and sensor models. To make the approach scalable to increasing network sizes, single-node and pairwise-node approximations to the mutual information are derived for general probability density models, with analytically bounded error. The pairwise-node approximation is proven to be a more accurate objective function than the single-node approximation. The mobile sensors are cooperatively controlled using a distributed optimization, yielding coordinated motion of the network. These methods are explored for various sensing modalities, including bearings-only sensing, range-only sensing, and magnetic field sensing, all with potential for search and rescue applications. For each sensing modality, the behavior of this non-parametric method is compared and contrasted with the results of linearized methods, and simulations are performed of a target search using the dynamics of actual vehicles. Monte Carlo results demonstrate that as network size increases, the sensors more quickly localize the target, and the pairwise-node approximation provides superior performance to the single-node approximation. The proposed methods are shown to produce similar results to linearized methods in particular scenarios, yet they capture effects in more general scenarios that are not possible with linearized methods.},

  Abstract                 = {While autonomous vehicles have the potential to enable many revolutionary technologies, assisting people through unprecedented automation, they introduce many challenges in control system design. One step toward increasing their autonomy is to formulate an optimization problem that exploits models connecting the eects of the sensing and control systems to optimize the performance of the overall system. Using these models, the robots are able to intelligently experiment with their environment to work toward achieving their goals. This thesis presents techniques to directly exploit the connection between sensing and control, focusing on algorithms for mobile sensors and mobile sensor networks. Algorithms are developed to compute information theoretic quantities using a particlelter representation of the probability distributions over the states being estimated. To make the approach scalable to increasing network size, single-node and pairwisenode approximations to the mutual information are derived for general probability density models, with analytical bounds on the error incurred, and computation time that is polynomial in the number of sensors. The pairwise-node approximation is proven to be a more accurate objective function than the single-node approximation. A decentralized optimization algorithm is presented to implement these techniques, using a novel collision avoidance method incorporating hybrid control. The characteristics of these algorithms are explored in simulation of autonomous search using three sensing modalities: range, bearing, and magnetic rescue beacon. For each sensing modality, the behavior of these non-parametric methods are compared and contrasted with the results of linearized methods. The proposed methods produce similar results in some scenarios, yet they capture effects in more general scenarios not possible with linearized methods. Monte Carlo results demonstrate that the pairwise-node approximation provides superior performance to the single-node approximation. To motivate and demonstrate these algorithms, a fleet of quadrotor helicopters is designed and used, the Stanford Testbed of Autonomous Rotorcraft for Multi- Agent Control (STARMAC). The algorithms are implemented as an autonomous guidance system onboard these aircraft to automate search for an avalanche rescue beacon. Vehicle design, dynamics, and control are presented. Experimental results demonstrate improved vehicle control over the state-of-the-art, and the ability to autonomously search for a lost rescue beacon.},

A real-time implementation of the algorithm was tested aboard a US Army UH-1 helicopter equipped with a Singer-Kearfott Doppler velocity sensor and a Litton LR-80 strapdown attitude and heading reference system (AHRS). The median radial error of the position fixes provided in real time by this implementation was less than 50 m for a variety of mission profiles. Although Heli/SITAN was demonstrated on a helicopter equipped with a Doppler aided AHRS, the extension to other types of aircraft and navigation systems is straightforward},

We investigated the potential impact of error in a USGS 30 m DEM on terrain analysis over 27 km2. The difference in elevation between 2652 differential Global Positioning Systems measurements and USGS 30-m DEM derived elevations provided the comparative error dataset. Analysis of this comparative error data suggested that although the global (average) error is small, local error values can be large, and also spatially correlated. Stochastic conditional simulation was used to generate multiple realizations of the DEM error surface that reproduce the error measurements at their original locations and sample statistics such as the histogram and semivariogram model. The differences between these alternative error surfaces provide a model of uncertainty for the unknown DEM error spatial distribution. These DEM errors had a significant impact on terrain attributes which compound elevation values of many grid cells (e.g. slope, wetness index, etc.). A case study using terrain modeling demonstrates that the result of error propagation is most dramatic in valley bottoms and along streamlines.},

We introduce the notion of a manifold map; this representation takes maps out of the plane and onto a two-dimensional surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space. Compared with standard planar maps, the key advantage of the manifold representation is self-consistency: manifold maps do not suffer from the 'cross over' problem that planar maps commonly exhibit in environments containing loops. This self-consistency facilitates a number of important autonomous capabilities, including robust retro-traverse, lazy loop closure, active loop closure using robot rendezvous, and, ultimately, autonomous exploration. By way of validation, this paper also includes experimental results obtained using teams of two to four robots in environments ranging in size from 400 m2 to 900 m2.},

We consider sensing, localization and mapping uncertainties in the motion planning subproblem. The robot is holonomic with known size and shape, and is equipped with a laser range sensor. We use a rapidly exploring randomized tree (RRT) in conjunction with a simulated particle based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm to expand the tree. The simulated SLAM explicitly accounts for sensor, localization and mapping uncertainty in the planning stage. Moreover, the RRT itself is represented in the augmented configuration space where an extra dimension of uncertainty is used. The collision likelihood along a planned path is explicitly computed and is used to select a planned path. Preliminary simulations show the effectiveness and benefits of our integrated approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Lidar data provide accurate measurements of forest canopy structure in the vertical plane however current lidar sensors have limited coverage in the horizontal plane. Landsat data provide extensive coverage of generalized forest structural classes in the horizontal plane but are relatively insensitive to variation in forest canopy height. It would therefore be desirable to integrate lidar and Landsat data to improve the measurement, mapping, and monitoring of forest structural attributes. We tested five aspatial and spatial methods for predicting canopy height, as measured by an airborne lidar system (Aeroscan), from Landsat ETM+ data: regression, kriging, cokriging, and kriging and cokriging of regression residuals. Our 200 km 2 study area in western Oregon encompassed Oregon State Universitys McDonald-Dunn Research Forest, which is broadly representative of the age and structural classes common in the region. We sampled our continuous lidar coverage in eight systematic patterns to determine which lidar sampling strategy would optimize lidar-Landsat integration: transects sampled at 2000, 1000, 500 and 250 m frequencies, and points sampled at these same spatial frequencies. The aspatial regression model results, regardless of sampling strategy, preserved actual vegetation pattern, but underestimated taller canopies and overestimated shorter canopies. The spatial models, kriging and cokriging, produced less biased results than regression but poorly reproduced vegetation pattern. The integrated models that kriged or cokriged regression residuals were preferable to either the aspatial or spatial models alone, because they preserved the vegetation pattern like regression yet improved estimation accuracies above those predicted from the regression models alone. We concluded that in our study landscape,},

The surface of the planetary body is largely covered with powdery soil. On such loose soil, the wheel slippage which will make the rover get stuck must be concerned. Since the slippage dynamically depends on the posture/velocity of vehicle, soil characteristics, and wheel-soil interactions, it becomes difficult issues to incorporate the wheel slip dynamics as a criterion into path-planning algorithms. To tackle the slippage problem, the authors develop the path-planning algorithm and the path-evaluation method based on the following approach. First, a path on a rough terrain is generated with the terrain-based criteria function. Subsequently, the dynamics simulation of a rover is carried out in which the rover is controlled to follow the candidate path. Finally, the path is properly evaluated based on the slip motion profiles calculated by the simulation. Demonstrations for the proposed technique are addressed along with a discussion on characteristics of the candidate path and the slip motion profile of the rover},

In this system, both the correlation method and the parallel Kalman filters are utilized to calculate the position by analyzing the difference between the DEM data and the set of height measurements, which is collected in real time. Two obtained position are used to correct the possible estimation error, caused by the repetitive characteristic of terrain or the noise of measurements. Compared with the TAN system uses only the correlation method, simulation results approve the proposed system can significantly improve the navigation performance.},

  Abstract                 = {The driving precision landing requirement for the Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology project is to autonomously land within 100 m of a predetermined location on the lunar surface. Traditional lunar landing approaches based on inertial sensing do not have the navigational precision to meet this requirement. The purpose of Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) is to augment inertial navigation by providing position or bearing measurements relative to known surface landmarks. From these measurements, the navigational precision can be reduced to a level that meets the 100 m requirement. There are three different TRN functions: global position estimation, local position estimation and velocity estimation. These functions can be achieved with active range sensing or passive imaging. This paper gives a survey of many TRN approaches and then presents some high fidelity simulation results for contour matching and area correlation approaches to TRN using active sensors. Since TRN requires an a-priori reference map, the paper concludes by describing past and future lunar imaging and digital elevation map data sets available for this purpose.},

Prior to vehicle's launch, a genetic algorithm based on ocean floor data and on mission restrictions calculates the optimal path. Once the path is calculated, the vehicle is navigated through the predefined path by a set of fuzzy controllers. A second evolutionary algorithm optimizes the membership functions of these controllers so as the vehicle has the minimum error through its course.

First, the Cramer Rao lower bound (CRLB) along the experimental trajectory is computed, which is only slightly lower than the particle filter estimate after initial transients. Simple rule of thumbs for how performance depends on the map and sensor quality are derived. Second, a more realistic five state model is proposed, and Rao-Blackwellization is applied to decrease computational complexity. Monte-Carlo simulations on the map demonstrate a performance comparable to the CRLB.},

In this paper the quality of DEMs derived from the interpolation of photogrammetrically derived elevation points in Alberta, Canada, is tested. DEMs with grid cell sizes ranging from 100 to 5 m were interpolated from 100 m regularly spaced elevation points and numerous surface-specific point elevations using the ANUDEM interpolation method. In order to identify the grid resolution that matches the information content of the source data, three approaches were applied: density analysis of point elevations, an analysis of cumulative frequency distributions using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the root mean square slope measure. Results reveal that the optimum grid cell size is between 5 and 20 m, depending on terrain com-plexity and terrain derivative. Terrain variables based on 100 m regularly sampled elevation points are compared to an independent high-resolution DEM used as a benchmark. Subsequent correlation analysis reveals that only elevation and local slope have a strong positive relationship while all other terrain derivatives are not represented realistically when derived from a coarse DEM. Calculations of root mean square errors and relative root mean square errors further quantify the quality of terrain derivatives.},

  Abstract                 = {This dissertation addresses the problem of control input design for a system whose state observability is dependent on it's state trajectory. Speci¯cally, it describes the development of a new control algorithm which exploits the coupling between observability and trajectory to improve the overall stochastic control performance. Many control systems which su®er from a lack of observability due to a limited sensing capability can bene¯t from this proposed control technique. This research was motivated by automatic docking control for an unmanned ve- hicle whose goal is to reach a target dock at a desired speed and direction without any human aid or intervention. Accomplishing this requires the ability to determine relative position accurately, and this in turn depends on the degree of observability of the system. The approach used to develop this new control algorithm is to pose the problem as a nonlinear stochastic control problem incorporating a cost term which weights the system state uncertainty. The resulting form of the problem is similar to linear quadratic control and can be solved using computationally e±cient methods. The overall result is a systematic controller design procedure that avoids both the compu- tational complexity of dynamic programming approaches and the heuristics typical of approximate methods. To demonstrate the feasibility and utility of this new approach, it is applied to the limiting-case problem of monocular vision-based docking of a kinematic vehicle. The monocular vision sensor provides bearings-only information without range, and thus the system is unobservable in terms of traditional linear observability. The newly designed docking controller generates trajectories that both satisfy the docking control goal, and improve the system's observability simultaneously. Both simulation and experimental results are presented for a wheeled rover system.},

We are developing a route following system which is based upon features extracted from the seabed using sidescan sonar collected in a training phase. Through matching of sonar images, this system navigates over a path without the need for a continual global position estimate. At the core of this system is the need to reliably extract features and match images derived from the sonar. At our disposal is an array of algorithms which implement the OpenCV common interface for feature extraction and matching. Using pre-collected sets of data we compare the performance of several of these algorithms in the context of matching sonar image tiles. Our results compare the performance of various feature types over two common sets of data. The feature types tested include SIFT[12], SURF[3], MSER[13], STAR[1], ORB[15], and BRIEF[4].},

  Abstract                 = {Memorial University is in the development stages of a Qualitative Navigation System (QNS) to be deployed on the Memorial Explorer AUV. This system will allow localization and path following along a trained route without the necessity of a globally referenced position estimate. Previous QNS work has been on terrestrial robots using optical images. Our main challenge lies in utilization of side scan sonar as the imaging medium, as this type of sonar is prevalent on AUVs and provides much better range and coverage than optics in water. To achieve this, a sonar image processing and registration framework has been developed. To be useful such a framework should be fully-autonomous, robust, and operate in real-time, where real-time operation is defined as the ability to process, register and localize data at the rate it is collected, or faster. In this paper we describe our framework for processing sonar data, generating image tiles, extracting unique features and localizing against a reference set. We also present some results of this system based on raw sonar input data collected by the AUV.},

  Abstract                 = {Bayesian filtering is a general framework for recursively estimating the state of a dynamical system. Key components of each Bayes filter are probabilistic prediction and observation models. This paper shows how non-parametric Gaussian process (GP) regression can be used for learning such models from training data. We also show how Gaussian process models can be integrated into different versions of Bayes filters, namely particle filters and extended and unscented Kalman filters. The resulting GP-BayesFilters can have several advantages over standard (parametric) filters. Most importantly, GP-BayesFilters do not require an accurate, parametric model of the system. Given enough training data, they enable improved tracking accuracy compared to parametric models, and they degrade gracefully with increased model uncertainty. These advantages stem from the fact that GPs consider both the noise in the system and the uncertainty in the model. If an approximate parametric model is available, it can be incorporated into the GP, resulting in further performance improvements. In experiments, we show different properties of GP-BayesFilters using data collected with an autonomous micro-blimp as well as synthetic data.},

  Abstract                 = { An important assumption underlying virtually all approaches to multi-robot exploration is prior knowledge about their relative locations. This is due to the fact that robots need to merge their maps so as to coordinate their exploration strategies. The key step in map merging is to estimate the relative locations of the individual robots. This paper presents a novel approach to multi-robot map merging under global uncertainty about the robot's relative locations. Our approach uses an adapted version of particle filters to estimate the position of one robot in the other robot's partial map. The risk of false-positive map matches is avoided by verifying match hypotheses using a rendezvous approach. We show how to seamlessly integrate this approach into a decision-theoretic multi-robot coordination strategy. The experiments show that our sample-based technique can reliably find good hypotheses for map matches. Furthermore, we present results obtained with two robots successfully merging their maps using the decision-theoretic rendezvous strategy.},

We have developed a robust qualitative method for robot exploration, mapping, and navigation in large-scale spatial environments. Experiments with a simulated robot in a variety of complex 2D environments have demonstrated that our qualitative method can build an accurate map of a previously unkown environment in spite of substantial random and systematic sensorimotor error. Most current approaches to robot exploration and mapping analyze sensor input to build a geometrically precise map of the environment, then extract topological structure from the geometric description. Our approach recognizes and exploits qualitative properties of large-scale before relatively error-prone geometrical properties. [sensorimotor <--> control] --> topology --> geometry At the control level, distinctive places and distinctive travel edges are identified based on the interaction between the robot's control strategies, its sensorimotor system, and the world. A distinctive place is defined as the local maximum of a distinctiveness measure appropriate to its immediate neighborhood, and is found by a hill-climbing control strategy. A distinctive travel edge, similarly, is defined by a suitable measure and a path-following control strategy. The topological network description is created by linking the distinctive places and travel edges.Metrical information is then incrementally assimilated into localgeometric descriptions of places and edges, and finally merged into a global geometric map. Topological ambiguity arising from sensorily indistinguishable places can be resolved at the topological level by the exploration strategy. With this representation, successful navigation is not critically dependent on the accuracy, or even the existence, of the geometrical description. We present examples demonstrating the process by which the robot explores and builds a map of a complex environment, including the effect of sensory errors. We also discuss new research directions that are suggested by this approach.},

The contribution of this paper is in the proposal of a hybrid technique to mitigate sample impoverishment such that the number of particles required and hence the computation complexities are reduced. Studies are conducted through the use of Chebyshev inequality for the number of particles required. The relationship between the number of particles and the time for impoverishment is examined by considering the takeover phenomena as found in genetic algorithms. It is revealed that the sample impoverishment problem is caused by the resampling scheme in implementing the particle filter with a finite number of particles. The use of uniform or roulette-wheel sampling also contributes to the problem. Crossover operators from genetic algorithms are adopted to tackle the finite particle problem by re-defining or re-supplying impoverished particles during filter iterations. Effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulations for a monobot simultaneous localization and mapping application.},

This is especially the case for data association algorithms, where false feature matches can lead to the localization system failure. In rough terrain, the field of view can vary significantly between two feature extraction steps, so a good position prediction is necessary to robustly track features. This paper presents a method for combining dead reckoning sensor information in order to provide an initial estimate of the six degrees of freedom of a rough terrain rover. An inertial navigation system (INS) and the wheel encoders are used as sensory inputs. The sensor fusion scheme is based on an extended information filter (EIF) and is extensible to any kind and number of sensors. In order to test the system, the rover has been driven on different kind of obstacles while computing both pure 3D-odometric and fused INS/3D-odometry trajectories. The results show that the use of the INS significantly improves the pose prediction.},

This paper presents a new navigation system (a self-calibrating pseudolite array) that can provide centimeter-level, drift-free localization to multiple rovers within a local area by utilizing GPS-based transceivers deployed in a ground-based array. Such a system of localized beacons can replace or augment a system based on orbiting satellite transmitters, and is capable of fully autonomous operations and calibration. This paper describes the prototype SCPA that has been developed at Stanford to demonstrate these capabilities and then presents new results from the most recent set of field trials performed at NASA Ames Research Center. These experiments, which utilize the K9 Mars rover research platform, validate both the navigation and self-calibration capabilities of the system.},

Therefore, we propose the decomposition of a linear process model into a cascade of simpler subsystems and the use of a Kalman filter to individually estimate the states of these subsystems. Both a theoretical comparison and simulation examples are presented. The theoretical results show that the distributed observers, except for special cases, do not minimize the overall error covariance, and the distributed observer system is therefore suboptimal. However, in practice, the performance achieved by the cascaded observers is comparable and in certain cases even better than the performance of the centralized observer. A distributed observer system also leads to increased modularity, reduced complexity, and lower computational costs.},

This result is derived based on an observability analysis of the EKF's linearized system model, which proves that the yaw erroneously appears to be observable. In order to address this problem, we propose modifications to the multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) algorithm [1], which ensure the correct observability properties without incurring additional computational cost.

We are in the process of developing a method for the integration of orbital and ground image networks to enhance precision mapping. In this research, HiRISE stereo images were used as orbital data while ground data include MER-B Pancam stereo images and their pointing information. The process of estimating unknown exterior orientation parameters for the HiRISE images is explained. For orbital image processing, a semi-automatic hierarchical stereo matching technique based on image pyramid is introduced. A bundle adjustment of HiRISE stereo pair is performed. Incremental bundle adjustment technology is employed to process MER ground images, to construct a ground image network and to improve rover localization accuracy. Also, digital terrain models (DTMs) and orthophotos of Victoria Crater have been generated from the HiRISE stereo pair and are compared with those derived from the networked ground imagery. I.}

  Abstract                 = {Terrain Aided Navigation (TAN) system has been widely used in aerial and underwater vehicles for its autonomy, anti-electromagnetic interference (anti-EMI) and all-weather advantages. TAN system is also a multi-sensor system usually consists of radar altimeter, barometric altimeter, laser scanner, echo sounder, inertial navigation system (INS) and so on. It fuses the information from different sensors to highly improve the positioning accuracy that can not be acquired by a single positioning system, such as INS. However, the positioning accuracy of TAN can be easily affected by the altimeter measurement errors which may caused by atmosphere turbulence or water current. This paper focuses on the effort to overcome the influences of these aspects. We propose a high dimensional measurement drift system model that incorporates measurement bias and drift aspects, which can model the influences above. The recursive Bayesian filter is used for analytic solutions, while a modified SIR particle filter is in charge of numerically calculating the results. The paper also examines the traditional model without measurement drift for comparison. From the simulation results, the positioning accuracy of the measurement drift model has improved by approximate one order of magnitude than the traditional model.},

The process of determining the pose of a mobile robot with respect to a global reference frame in situations where no a priori estimate of the robot's location is available is cast as a problem of searching for correspondences between measurements and an a priori map of the environment. A physically-based sonar sensor model is used to characterize the geometric constraints provided by echolocation measurements of different types of objects. Individual range returns are used as data features in a constraint-based search to determine the robot's position. A hypothesize and test technique is employed in which positions of the robot are calculated from all possible combinations of two range returns that satisfy the measurement model. The algorithm determines the positions which provide the best match between the range returns and the environment model. The performance of the approach is demonstrated using data from both a single scanning Polaroid sonar and from a ring of Polaroid sonar sensors},

However, it has a lack of such prepared reference maps at present. In this paper, an integrated navigation system based on the correlation between gravity gradient and terrain fluctuation is proposed, and the system can avoid any use of gravity maps. According to the correlation between gravity gradient and terrain, the calculating value of gravity gradient abnormal at the estimated position of the submarine can be obtained by high-precision digital elevation model, and the measurement value can also get from gradiometer. By using the difference of them, the system optimal filter generates real-time adjustment to the navigational errors. This method avoids the shortage of gravity field data presently. In addition, the system guarantees the safety of submarine at the same time because there is no transmission of signals outward from the vehicle during measurements of the gravity gradient.},

LiDAR data are obtained on a point support and it is necessary to interpolate to a regular grid if a digital surface model (DSM) is required. When the data are numerous, and close together in space, simple linear interpolation algorithms are usually considered sufficient. In this letter, inverse distance weighting (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK) and kriging with a trend model (KT) are assessed for the construction of DSMs from LiDAR data. It is shown that the advantages of KT become more apparent as the number of data points decrease (and the sample spacing increases). It is argued that KT may be advantageous in some instances where the desire is to derive a DSM from LiDAR point data but in many cases a simpler approach, such as IDW, may suffice. },

single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images.
This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by
matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm,
followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification
through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify
objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

The method controls vertical motion while placing almost no restrictions on motion in the horizontal plane, achieving high compatibility with existing navigation scheme. The algorithm is a hybrid of sensor and map based approaches where the vehicle continually updates a local geometrical map of hazard areas using its perceptional measurements while performing conventional auto-altitude tracking. If the vehicle enters any of the hazard areas, sensor based control is invoked with depth as the control reference to elevate the AUV until it passes the hazard area. The method was verified through tank experiments using the AUV Tri-Dog 1. The AUV successfully followed a lawn-mower trajectory over a rugged terrain consisting of knolls and slopes while maintaining an extremely low altitude of 1.2 meters.},

  Abstract                 = {Global Positioning System (GPS) is a common choice for positioning in Land vehicle navigation system technology. However, GPS alone is incapable of providing continuous and reliable positioning, because of its inherent dependency on external electromagnetic signals. Inertial Navigation System (INS) is the implementation of inertial sensors to determine the position and orientation of a vehicle. As such, inertial navigation has unbounded error growth since the error accumulates at each step. Thus in order to contain these errors some form of external aiding is required. The availability of low cost Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System (MEMS) inertial sensors is now making it feasible to develop INS using an inertial measurement unit (IMU). INS/GPS integrated systems, based on MEMS technology, are recently subject of great interest. Typically IMU's are very expensive systems; however this INS will use ldquolow costrdquo components. The current performance achieved by low-cost IMUs is still relatively poor due to the large inertial sensor errors. This can significantly affect the performance of the integrated system in situations of low satellite visibility. Usually, GPS and INS are integrated with a loosely coupled scheme, which is suitable for those applications where satellite availability is always good. The integration of GPS with INS can be implemented using a Kalman filter. For simplicity and in case of land vehicle navigation in short travelling distance the earth can be considered as flat earth model. This paper introduces a low cost INS/GPS algorithm that can be used for navigation of a car like robot. The data fusion process is done with an extended Kalman filter in cascade configuration mode. In order to perform numerical simulations, MATLAB software has been developed. Loosely coupled configuration is considered. The results obtained in this work demonstrate that a low-cost INS/GPS navigation system is partially capable of meeting the performance requirements - for land vehicle navigation. The paper also provides experimental results. The relative effectiveness of the cascaded kalman filter implementation in integrated GPS/INS navigation algorithm is highlighted.

  Abstract                 = {This work aims at improving real-time motion control and dead-reckoning of wheeled skid-steer vehicles by considering the effects of slippage, but without introducing the complexity of dynamics computations in the loop. This traction scheme is found both in many off-the-shelf mobile robots due to its mechanical simplicity and in outdoor applications due to its maneuverability. In previous works, we reported a method to experimentally obtain an optimized kinematic model for skid-steer tracked vehicles based on the boundedness of the instantaneous centers of rotation (ICRs) of treads on the motion plane. This paper provides further insight on this method, which is now proposed for wheeled skid-steer vehicles. It has been successfully applied to a popular research robotic platform, pioneer P3-AT, with different kinds of tires and terrain types.},

  Abstract                 = {For map-matching navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles, the central problem is localizing a sonar (or video) image of the seafloor in an existing global bathymetric map. The terrain-relative navigation methodology presented is grounded in the Kalman filter framework and uses its three basic steps: prediction, measurement, and update. In the prediction step, the vehicle location with uncertainty (state and state covariance) is estimated by using the previous vehicle location and dead reckoning. In the measurement step, the current sonar image is matched to the map using the mean absolute difference dissimilarity parameter. Because of the potential for large uncertainties in both the depth values of the image and those of the map, a suite of good matches is accepted rather than the single best match. The location of each match is considered a measurement of the vehicle position. Finally, each match (measurement) is weighted probabilistically using data association techniques, and the resulting best estimate and associated uncertainties comprise the navigation update. This updated position is then used as a basis for the next prediction step, and the process is repeated. Using real bathymetric data from a section of seafloor near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the Kane and Atlantis transforms, a simulation showing the success of this algorithm is presented},

  Abstract                 = {A "Self-Calibrating Pseudolite Array (SCPA)" is a self-deployable GPS pseudolite-based local-area navigation system applicable to future-generation Mars rovers. By utilizing bidirectional GPS transceivers (incorporating separate GPS pseudolites and GPS receivers) deployed in a ground-based array, the SCPA can provide all the benefits of satellite-based Carrier-phase Differential GPS (CDGPS), such as drift-free, centimeter-level, and three-dimensional positioning, without requiring a satellite constellation on Mars. Relative geometry change by moving the rover enables the SCPA to self-calibrate both the array locations and the rover trajectory to centimeter-level accuracy. This self-calibration capability of the SCPA overcomes the difficulty of autonomous robotic deployment of the pseudolite-based navigation system on Mars, eliminating the need for accurate a priori position information or precise placement of the array. This paper presents new results from the latest field trial of the SCPA conducted in February 2004 using the K9 Mars rover platform operated in the Marscape at NASA Ames Research Center. This field trial demonstrates the entire scenario of the SCPA operation, starting with autonomous array deployment, followed by array self-calibration and centimeter-level navigation for a long traverse. The results show that a 0.2% drift rate is achieved by the SCPA navigation (0.4 meter of the final positioning error after a 174.7 meter traverse).},

This, in turn, allows the elimination of rate and barometric sensors for the control of these aircraft that have specified stability characteristics. Specifically, eliminating rate sensors and barometric sensors requires the avionics system to be integrated into a longitudinally and laterally stable configuration where it can process 4 hertz navigation data rapidly and accurately. The architecture of the avionic suite presented here was integrated into a stable, flyable model aircraft and flight tested. The lateral dynamics of the remote control aircraft were evaluated, and a first order transfer function for the lateral dynamics of the aircraft was generated. This was used to design gains and ultimately achieve autonomous heading-hold capabilities. Combined with real-time data acquisition and live streaming in-flight video, an affordable and flyable UAV system was created without rate and barometric sensors.},

Most images will include color data covering 20% of the potential field of view. A top priority is to acquire ?1000 stereo pairs and apply precision geometric corrections to enable topographic measurements to better than 25 cm vertical precision. We expect to return more than 12 Tb of HiRISE data during the 2-year PSP, and use pixel binning, conversion from 14 to 8 bit values, and a lossless compression system to increase coverage. HiRISE images are acquired via 14 CCD detectors, each with 2 output channels, and with multiple choices for pixel binning and number of Time Delay and Integration lines. HiRISE will support Mars exploration by locating and characterizing past, present, and future landing sites, unsuccessful landing sites, and past and potentially future rover traverses. We will investigate cratering, volcanism, tectonism, hydrology, sedimentary processes, stratigraphy, aeolian processes, mass wasting, landscape evolution, seasonal processes, climate change, spectrophotometry, glacial and periglacial processes, polar geology, and regolith properties.

  Abstract                 = {An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), Autosub6000, has been shown to operate safely at altitudes as low as 3?m above rugged and complex sea floor environments. This capability is essential for future AUV missions in such environments, e.g. high-resolution surveys using colour photography or multi-beam sonar bathymetry. This was achieved through the development of an obstacle avoidance system for the AUV, incorporating relatively low-cost off-the-shelf components and simple algorithms. This paper details the specification, design, and testing at sea of Autosub6000's obstacle avoidance system. It describes how the specification of the system was influenced by the need to retrofit it into the existing control architecture, together with the pragmatic need to minimize overall complexity. The sensor used in the obstacle avoidance system is a mechanically scanned forward-looking sonar, and the control algorithm is based upon the detection of the range and elevation of the horizon relative to the AUV. The avoidance behaviour is by default to fly over obstacles but, if this is not possible, a turn-around and retry collision avoidance algorithm is invoked. Results are presented of the system's performance during recent deep-water trials of the AUV over the Casablanca Seamount region of the Atlantic Ocean.},

In the multiple model approach, a bank of identical EKF's, each of which is initialized at a different point in the a priori uncertainty basket, is employed to ensure that one filter is initialized near the true aircraft position. In this manner, the probability of filter convergence is increased substantially, leading to improved navigation performance.},

Here we consider the case in which the true values ofQandRare unknown. The system is assumed to be constant, and the random inputs are stationary. First, a correlation test is given which checks whether a particular Kalman filter is working optimally or not. If the filter is suboptimal, a technique is given to obtain asymptotically normal, unbiased, and consistent estimates ofQandR. This technique works only for the case in which the form ofQis known and the number of unknown elements inQis less thann times rwherenis the dimension of the state vector andris the dimension of the measurement vector. For other cases, the optimal steady-state gain Kopis obtained directly by an iterative procedure without identifyingQ. As a corollary, it is shown that the steady-state optimal Kalman filter gain Kopdepends only onn times rlinear functionals ofQ. The results are first derived for discrete systems. They are then extended to continuous systems. A numerical example is given to show the usefulness of the approach.},

The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm is a planning technique that accounts for effects such as vehicle dynamics by incrementally building a tree of reachable states. pRRT extends the conventional RRT algorithm by explicitly considering uncertainty in sensing, modeling, and actuation by treating each addition to the tree as a stochastic process. The pRRT algorithm has been experimentally verified in simulation, and shown to produce plans that are significantly more robust than conventional RRT. Our recent work has investigated several vehicle models to improve the performance and accuracy of the pRRT algorithm in simulation. Based on these results, we have integrated the simulator with the iRobot ATRV-Jr hardware platform and tested and verified the pRRT algorithm using IPC communication. I.},

The reference map consists of a single line of bathymetric data, one swath width across, spanning the operational area of a survey mission. This map is collected by Autosub prior to undertaking the survey. This paper presents a discussion of the biases in typical AUV navigational sensors and their influence on navigation on a map that is created in-mission by a submersible. Based on this discussion a filter has been implemented and has been used to analyse the navigational errors accumulated during an Autosub 6000 survey mission and computational limitations for realtime application are assessed.},

As such, we present a systemic approach to autonomous topological exploration of a mine environment to facilitate the process of mapping. This approach focuses upon the interaction of three high-level processes: topological planning, intersection identification and local navigation. Topological planning tasks the robot to investigate stretches of mine corridor for the purpose of collecting data. Intersection identification converts sensory input into topological components used to construct an online topological map and provide the robot with a global sense of position. Local navigation transforms topological exploration objectives into robot actuation enabling traversal of mine corridors. These processes are described in detail with results presented from experiments conducted at a research coal mine near Pittsburgh, PA.},

Increasing the number of particles is not always possible so it is essential for many applications to assess the reliability of the solution provided by the filter. In terrain navigation, trusting an erroneous position estimate can be problematic for obvious reasons. We introduce a framework for detecting filter divergence in the case of scalar measurements. The detector is based on a sequential change detection algorithm and we illustrate its performance on several terrain navigation scenarios.},

Original formulations required that there be sufficiently many locations where data is available for both variables. The pseudo-cross-variogram, introduced by Clark et al. (1989), allows computing a related empirical spatial function in order to model the function, which can then be used in the cokriging equations in lieu of the cross-variogram. A number of questions left unanswered by Clark et al. are resolved, such as the availability of valid models, an appropriate definition of positive-definiteness, and the relationship of the pseudo-cross-variogram to the usual cross-variogram. The latter is important for modeling this function.},

The method stochastically determines vehicle's position relative to the map using the Particle Filter method, based on an inertial navigation system (INS) and a profiling sonar mounted on the vehicle. The reference bathymetric map is constructed a prior, either by the vehicle itself, or by other platforms.

This sudden reduction in performance of the correlation based time delay estimators at low SNR arises from the misidentification of one unique "extremum" in very noisy conditions and from the peak fitting procedure in the case of the subsample time delay estimation. In this paper, two new estimators-the MSX and MXS-for the estimation of subsample time delays in narrow-band signals are proposed. In these estimators, cross-correlations and autocorrelations are matched at a number of different lags to yield a number of time delay estimates which are subsequently combined to obtain one robust time delay estimate. They seem to perform adequately over the SNR range used in simulations of -5 to 20 dB. Their performances are compared to those of two cross-correlation based estimators. Using simulated data, it is demonstrated that all four estimators perform well at high SNR, but at low SNR the proposed MSX and MXS estimators offer significant improvements in the bias and variance of the estimates. Additionally, these findings are verified using ultrasonic experimental data at three different SNR.},

The current sensor pose is simultaneously obtained by tracking the live depth frame relative to the global model using a coarse-to-fine iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which uses all of the observed depth data available. We demonstrate the advantages of tracking against the growing full surface model compared with frame-to-frame tracking, obtaining tracking and mapping results in constant time within room sized scenes with limited drift and high accuracy. We also show both qualitative and quantitative results relating to various aspects of our tracking and mapping system. Modelling of natural scenes, in real-time with only commodity sensor and GPU hardware, promises an exciting step forward in augmented reality (AR), in particular, it allows dense surfaces to be reconstructed in real-time, with a level of detail and robustness beyond any solution yet presented using passive computer vision.},

Experimental results show that for a weakly nonlinear tracking problem, the extended Kalman filter and the unscented Kalman filter are good choices, while a particle filter should be used for problems with strong nonlinearity. To quantitatively determine the nonlinearity of a nonlinear tracking problem, we propose two types of measures: one is the differential geometry curvature measure and the other is based on the normalized innovation squared (NIS) of the Kalman filter. Simulation results show that both measures can effectively quantify the nonlinearity of the problem. The NIS is capable of detecting the filter divergence online. The curvature measure is more suitable for quantifying the nonlinearity of a tracking problem as determined via simulations.},

The solution is characterized by a joint design of INS and TAP, meaning that the highly nonlinear TAP is not designed separately but jointly with the INS using one and the same filter. The applied filter extends the theory of the MPF (marginalized particle filter) given by. The key idea with MPF is to estimate the nonlinear part using the particle filter (PF), and the part which is linear, conditional upon the nonlinear part, is estimated using the Kalman filter. The extension lies in the possibility to deal with a third multimodal part, where the discrete mode variable is also estimated jointly with the linear and nonlinear parts. Conditionally upon the mode and the nonlinear part, the resulting subsystem is linear and estimated using the Kalman filter. Given the nonlinear motion equations which the INS uses to compute navigation data, the INS equations must be linearized for the MPF to work. A set of linearized equations is derived and the linearization errors are shown to be insignificant with respect to the final result. Simulations are performed and the result indicates near-optimal accuracy when compared with the Cramer-Rao lower bound.},

For accuracy and reliability reasons, several sensors are integrated together, and here we are dealing with dead-reckoning integrated with terrain-aided positioning. Terrain-aided positioning suffers from severe nonlinear structure, meaning that we have to solve a nonlinear recursive Bayesian estimation problem. This is not possible to do exactly, but recursive Monte Carlo methods, also known as particle filters, provide a promising approximate solution. To reduce the computational load of the normally rather computer intensive particle filter we present an algorithm which takes advantage of linear structure. The algorithm is based on a Rao-Blackwellisation technique, meaning that we marginalise the full conditional posterior density with respect to the linear part. The linear part of the state vector is estimated using multiple Kalman filters, and the particle filter is then used for the remaining part. Simulations show that the computational load is reduced significantly.},

Furthermore it should be easy to incorporate with the vehicle's inertial navigation system (INS) so a bound can be placed on the system's position error. This paper describes the terrain navigation system developed for the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration's autonomous vehicles AUV62F and Sapphires. Both vehicles are battery powered and torpedo shaped with a diameter of 21". From the outset, the terrain navigation system was designed to work in flat bottomed areas; it uses many simultaneous sonar beams (400+) to measure the bottom topography, producing a unique underwater map position for the vehicle. When terrain navigating in flat bottomed areas, bottom topography measurement often gives many possible vehicle positions, i.e., the probability density function of the vehicle position is multimodal, so efficient and robust nonlinear Kalman filtering must be used. The terrain navigation module uses an optimal nonlinear Kalman filter called the FD filter. The FD filter numerically solves the stochastic differential equation that guides the vehicle positioning. The measurement updating is Bayesian. The filtering procedure is characterized by robustness, simplicity, and accuracy. It is also simple to incorporate independent measurements other than the terrain topography into the filter.},

A three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model of surface vessels has been used for the controller design. In order for the control action to render good helmsman behavior, a MPC scheme with line-of-sight (LOS) path generation capability is formulated. Quadratic programming (QP) is used to solve a linear MPC by successive linearization along the LOS model of the surface vessel. Furthermore, we show that an LOS decision variable can be incorporated into the MPC design to improve the path following performance. The effectiveness of the developed control law is demonstrated via computer simulations.},

  Abstract                 = { Most mobile robots use a combination of absolute and relative sensing techniques for position estimation. Relative positioning techniques are generally known as dead-reckoning. Many systems use odometry as their only dead-reckoning means. However, fiber optic gyroscopes have become more affordable and are being used on many platforms to supplement odometry, especially in indoor applications. Still, if the terrain is not level (i.e., rugged or rolling terrain), the tilt of the vehicle introduces errors into the conversion of gyro readings to vehicle heading. In order to overcome this problem vehicle tilt must be measured and factored into the heading computation. The paper introduces a new fuzzy logic expert rule-based navigation (FLEXnav) method for fusing data from multiple low- to medium-cost gyroscopes and accelerometers in order to estimate accurately the heading and tilt of a mobile robot. Experimental results of mobile robot runs over rugged terrain are presented, showing the effectiveness of our FLEXnav method.},

  Abstract                 = {Geostatistics grew from meteorologists' desire to interpolate weather characteristics from sparse data, and from mining engineers who wanted to estimate quantities of minerals in bodies of rock from drill cores. In both cases the properties of interest behaved as spatially correlated random variables. Practice in mining is now underpinned by sound theory, the theory of regionalized variables. It is widely recognized that the theory is properly applicable in many other branches of earth, atmospheric and marine science. Part I of this paper reviews the more elementary aspects of the theory and its assumptions. It describes the method of local estimation embodied in regionalized variable theory known as kriging. The central tool of geostatistics is the variogram, which expresses quantitatively and succinctly spatially correlated variation, and its estimation is described. The more common forms of variogram are illustrated, and authorized models for them are listed. There are sound procedures for choosing and fitting models to variograms now using well-tried computer programs such as MLP and Genstat. Regionalized variable theory provides geographers with a concise and coherent methodology for describing and analysing spatially distributed data.},

The intent is to generate a path that enables an unmanned vehicle to surveil with maximum observability by traversing the ridges of a terrain or to operate with maximum covertness by navigating the valleys. The input to the algorithm is a 3D triangle mesh model for the terrain of interest. This mesh may be non-uniform and non-regular. Thus, the algorithm leverages research from computer graphics and computer vision to identify ridge-valley features on the terrain. These features serve as "obstacles" for an artificial potential field algorithm. The valleys are obstacles for a surveillance path, or the ridges are obstacles for a covert path. We incorporate geodesic-rather than Euclidean-distances into the potential field formulation to extend path planning to 3D surfaces. We present the theory of our proposed algorithm and provide experimental results},

  Abstract                 = {Real-time rendering and multiresolution modeling of triangulated surfaces has attracted growing interest over the last decade. For interactive visualization of very large scale grid digital elevation models efficiency is a particularly important aspect. The graphics rendering load must be controlled by reducing the number of rendered primitives using level-of-detail (LOD) techniques, adaptive extraction of LOD triangle meshes in main memory must be performed at interactive frame rates, and loading-on-demand of elevation data from secondary storage has to be highly efficient as well. Due to the high regularity of grid digital elevation models, hierarchical quadtree based terrain triangulation models have been shown to be among the most efficient methods available. In this paper we will survey and compare several approaches that follow this quadtree based surface decomposition and triangulation.}

Very soon, mission requirements will impose that planetary exploration rovers drive over-the-horizon in a single command cycle. This require an evolution of the methods and technologies currently used. This paper presents experimental validation of our over-the-horizon autonomous planetary navigation. We present our approach to 3D terrain reconstruction from large sparse range data sets, localization and autonomous navigation in a Mars-like terrain. Our approach is based on on-line acquisition of range scans, map construction from these scans, path planning and navigation using the map. An autonomy engine supervises the whole process ensuring the safe navigation of the planetary rover. The outdoor experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the reconstructed terrain model for rover localization, path planning and motion execution scenario as well as the autonomy capability of our approach.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a navigation system for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in partially structured environments, such as dams, harbors, marinas, and marine platforms. A mechanically scanned imaging sonar is used to obtain information about the location of vertical planar structures present in such environments. A robust voting algorithm has been developed to extract line features, together with their uncertainty, from the continuous sonar data flow. The obtained information is incorporated into a feature-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm running an extended Kalman filter. Simultaneously, the AUV's position estimate is provided to the feature extraction algorithm to correct the distortions that the vehicle motion produces in the acoustic images. Moreover, a procedure to build and maintain a sequence of local maps and to posteriorly recover the full global map has been adapted for the application presented. Experiments carried out in a marina located in the Costa Brava (Spain) with the Ictineu AUV show the viability of the proposed approach. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The main contribution of this paper is in significantly reducing the computational bottleneck inherent in existing simulation models due to the size and resolution of the complex seafloor models required for acoustic reverberation modelling. Discovery of the individual faces within the footprint of the acoustic beam at each ping is considerably accelerated by successfully adapting and integrating an optimised mesh refinement scheme intended for interactive rendering of large-scale complex surfaces described by polygonal meshes. Operational features of the simulator permit direct visualisation of the sonar image formed from successive echo lines and synthetic images generated during simulation are presented.},

Multibeam bathymetry from underwater water vehicles can yield valuable large scale terrain maps of the sea door, but the overall accuracy of these maps is typically limited by the accuracy of the vehicle position estimates. The solution presented here uses small bathymetric patches created over short time scales in a sub-mapping context. These patches are registered with respect to one another and assembled in a single coordinate frame to produce a more accurate terrain estimate and provide improved renavigation of the vehicle trajectory. The mapping is implemented using a delayed state extended Kalman filter (EKF) and results are shown for a real world multibeam data set collected at the mid-Atlantic ridge using the JASON ROV.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the problem of optimal control in continuous and partially observable environments when the parameters of the model are not known exactly. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a rich mathematical model to handle such environments but require a known model to be solved by most approaches. This is a limitation in practice as the exact model parameters are often difficult to specify exactly. We adopt a Bayesian approach where a posterior distribution over the model parameters is maintained and updated through experience with the environment. We propose a particle filter algorithm to maintain the posterior distribution and an online planning algorithm, based on trajectory sampling, to plan the best action to perform under the current posterior. The resulting approach selects control actions which optimally trade-off between 1) exploring the environment to learn the model, 2) identifying the system's state, and 3) exploiting its knowledge in order to maximize long-term rewards. Our preliminary results on a simulated robot navigation problem show that our approach is able to learn good models of the sensors and actuators, and performs as well as if it had the true model.},

Searching for moving targets typically involves planning over probability distributions, or beliefs, that characterize the possible locations of the target. Most motion strategies choose actions that reduce the uncertainty of the current belief by maximizing the predicted information gain of the next action, but computing good multi-step plans is usually computationally intractable (Sondik, 1971) due to the high dimensionality of the action and belief spaces. In this paper, we describe a novel algorithm for generating search plans using dynamic action spaces. The algorithm clusters a particle filter description of the current belief at each point in time, and uses search to compute a trajectory through the clusters in order to maximize information gain. This model allows us to efficiently compute finite-horizon multi-step plans in extremely high dimensional problems. We show preliminary results for an unknown target tracking problem},

  Abstract                 = {The law of likelihood explains how to interpret statistical data as evidence. Specifically, it gives to the discipline of statistics a precise and objective measure of the strength of statistical evidence supporting one probability distribution vis-a-vis another. That measure is the likelihood ratio. But evidence, even when properly interpreted, can be misleading-observations can truly constitute strong evidence supporting one distribution when the other is true. What makes statistical evidence valuable to science is that this cannot occur very often. Here we examine two bounds on the probability of observing strong misleading evidence. One is a universal bound, applicable to every pair of probability distributions. The other bound, much smaller, applies to all pairs of distributions within fixed-dimensional parametric models in large samples. The second bound comes from examining how the probability of strong misleading evidence varies as a function of the alternative value of the parameter. We show that in large samples one curve describes how this probability first rises and then falls as the alternative moves away from the true parameter value for a very wide class of models. We also show that this large-sample curve, and the bound that its maximum value represents, applies to profile likelihood ratios for one-dimensional parameters in fixed-dimensional parametric models, but does not apply to the estimated likelihood ratios that result from replacing the nuisance parameters by their global maximum likelihood estimates.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary. The strength of statistical evidence is measured by the likelihood ratio. Two key performance properties of this measure are the probability of observing strong misleading evidence and the probability of observing weak evidence. For the likelihood function associated with a parametric statistical model, these probabilities have a simple large sample structure when the model is correct. Here we examine how that structure changes when the model fails. This leads to criteria for determining whether a given likelihood function is robust (continuing to perform satisfactorily when the model fails), and to a simple technique for adjusting both likelihoods and profile likelihoods to make them robust. We prove that the expected information in the robust adjusted likelihood cannot exceed the expected information in the likelihood function from a true model. We note that the robust adjusted likelihood is asymptotically fully efficient when the working model is correct, and we show that in some important examples this efficiency is retained even when the working model fails. In such cases the Bayes posterior probability distribution based on the adjusted likelihood is robust, remaining correct asymptotically even when the model for the observable random variable does not include the true distribution. Finally we note a link to standard frequentist methodologyâin large samples the adjusted likelihood functions provide robust likelihood-based confidence intervals.},

  Abstract                 = {Variation in the computation of slope from digital elevation data can result in significantly different slope values and can, in turn, lead to widely varying estimates of environmental phenomena such as soil erosion that are highly dependent on slope. Ten methods of computing slope from distributed elevation data, utilizing capabilities inherent in five different geographic information systems (GIS), were compared with field measurements of slope. The methods were compared based on (1) overall estimation performance, (2) estimation accuracy, (3) estimation precision, and (4) independence of estimation errors and the magnitude of field measured slopes. A method utilizing a very high resolution digital elevation model (DEM) (1 m) produced slightly better estimates of slope than approaches utilizing somewhat lower resolution DEMs (25.2 m), and significantly better estimates than a method utilizing a 12.5 m DEM. The more accurate method was significantly biased, however, frequently underestimating actual slope. Methods that averaged or smoothed high resolution DEMs over larger areas also produced good estimates of slope, but these were somewhat less accurate in areas of shallow slopes. Methods utilizing differential geometry to compute percent slope from DEMs outperformed methods utilizing trigonometric functions. Errors in slope computation are exaggerated in soil erosion prediction models because erosion typically increases as a power function of slope.},

However, in exploration problems where the goal is to find an object or objects of interest, such techniques can be a useful heuristic but are optimising the wrong quantity. An example of such a problem is an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) searching the sea floor for hydrothermal vents. The state of the art in these problems is information lookahead in the action-observation space which is computationally expensive. We present an original belief-maximisation algorithm for this problem, and use a simulation of the AUV problem to show that our method outperforms straightforward entropy reduction and runs much faster than information lookahead while approaching it in terms of performance. We further introduce a heuristic using an orienteering-problem (OP) solver, which improves the performance of both our belief-maximisation algorithm and information lookahead.},

The improvement of sensor and satellite imaging technologies enabled the researchers to generate DEM using remotely sensed data. These data can be started to use as not only the two-dimensional (2-D) but also three-dimensional (3-D) information sources with usage of the DEM. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is one of the sensor systems capable of DEM generation and during the study, ASTER level 1A (L1A) data were used. Due to presence of many geological features and different landcover types, the test site is selected as the watershed of Asarsuyu River, located in north-western Anatolia in between Duzce and Bolu plains. The aim of this study is to check the best effort of 15 m spatial resolution DEM generation from ASTER L1A data by collecting different numbers of ground control points (GCP) (30, 45, and 60) and tie points (TP). During the study, three different techniquesspatial correlation, image differencing and profilingwere used for both planimetric and vertical accuracy assessment. The obtained results from both of the techniques show that the accuracy of the DEM increases by increasing the number of GCP. However, there is an only slight difference between the result of 45 GCPs and 60 GCPs.},

One remedy to this problem is to marginalize out the states appearing linearly in the dynamics. The result is that one Kalman filter is associated with each particle. The main contribution in this paper is the derivation of the details for the marginalized particle filter for a general nonlinear state-space model. Several important special cases occurring in typical signal processing applications will also be discussed. The marginalized particle filter is applied to an integrated navigation system for aircraft.

  Abstract                 = {Terrain aided positioning (TAP) is a kind of positioning method which acquires position information from the terrain elevation datum underneath the vehicle. This method has the characteristics of autonomy, all-weather, anti-interference, strong stealthiness and high accuracy. It is widely used in the navigation system for various aircrafts, cruise missiles and underwater vehicles. The fundamentals of TAP is that it firstly measures the terrain elevation underneath the vehicle using relevant sensors, then compares these datum with the referenced Digital Elevation Map (DEM) and acquires the position information through matching algorithm. The system model for TAP currently used totally depends on the referenced DEM and the position acquired is the position referenced to the map rather than the true position. Due to the DEM error which is introduced during production procedure, the position on the map is not the real position. In order to overcome the problem, the paper proposes an improved TAP model which introduces the map error into the system model and gets the recursive solution based on the Bayesian framework which is numerically solved by RPF particle filter. From the simulation results, the new model has extraordinary performance for handling the error of DEM and the algorithm can estimate the map error and acquire the accurate position.},

The methodology used poses the problem as a discrete time path following control problem where a conveniently defined error state space model of the plant is augmented with bathymetric (i.e., depth) preview data. A piecewise affine parameter-dependent model representation is adopted that describes the AUV linearized error dynamics for a predefined set of operating regions. For each region, a state feedback H 2 control problem for affine parameter-dependent systems is posed and solved using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The resulting nonlinear controller is implemented as a gain-scheduled controller using the D-methodology. Simulation results obtained with a nonlinear dynamic model of the INFANTE AUV in the vertical plane are presented and discussed.},

However, the rate of convergence of the map has a strong dependence on the order of the observations. We show that conventional exploration algorithms for collecting map data are sub-optimal in both the objective function and choice of optimization procedure. We show that optimizing the a-optimal information measure results in a more accurate map than existing approaches, using a greedy, closed-loop strategy. Secondly, we demonstrate that by restricting the planning to an appropriate policy class, we can tractably find non-greedy, global planning trajectories that produce more accurate maps, explicitly planning to close loops even in open-loop scenarios.},

We illustrate the strengths of our design with data obtained during two research cruises associated with mapping coral reefs off Puerto Rico and Bermuda.

  Abstract                 = {A point set obtained by laser altimetry represents points from not only the ground surface but also objects found on it. For civil works applications points representing the surface of non-ground objects have to be removed from the point set in a filtering process. This paper describes modifications made to an existing slope based filtering algorithm, and presents some results obtained from the use of the filter. The slope based filter operates on the assumption that terrain slopes do not rise above a certain threshold, and that features in the data that have slopes above this threshold do not belong to the natural terrain surface. However, this assumption limits the use of the filter to terrain with gentle slopes. To overcome this limitation, the filter was modified in manner that the threshold varies with respect to the slope of the terrain. The results of tests carried out using the modified filter confirm that the modification reduces the number of Type I errors (ground points in steep terrain are not filtered off). Further numerical comparison of the filter output with a reference data set for the same site (obtained photogrammetrically) show that the filter generates relatively minimal Type II errors. The output of the modified slope filter was also compared with the output from a filtering found in the commercial software package, Terrascan.},

Two free-drifting icebergs, 0.1 and 30.8 square kilometers in aerial surface area, and the surrounding waters were sampled in the northwest Weddell Sea during austral spring 2005. There was substantial enrichment of terrigenous material, and there were high concentrations of chlorophyll, krill, and seabirds surrounding each iceberg, extending out to a radial distance of ?3.7 kilometers. Extrapolating these results to all icebergs in the same size range, with the use of iceberg population estimates from satellite surveys, indicates that they similarly affect 39% of the surface ocean in this region. These results suggest that free-drifting icebergs can substantially affect the pelagic ecosystem of the Southern Ocean and can serve as areas of enhanced production and sequestration of organic carbon to the deep sea.},

The prototype has been designed to provide tunable stability characteristics, low relative heave motions, and increased overall survivability when compared to current lab scale autonomous surface craft platforms. The vehicle's primary mission will be to operate as a deployment platform for oceanographic data collection and ice reconnaissance. The secondary purpose of the prototype is to provide proof of concept and performance data which will be used to validate the developed numerical models. The prototype vehicle will also provide valuable lessons learned to be applied for a full scale vessel design. Although the vehicle has been developed as a large scale model, it has been outfitted with a full electronics system including controls, sensors and payloads. This prototype replaces the traditional tank testing of a model generally associated with new hull designs. The design of the hull, launch and recovery considerations, and propulsion power estimates are discussed. The paper also describes the process through which the design was completed, the current status of the project, and the expected outcomes of the prototype development project.}

The system components include a MEMS inertial measurement unit, a three-axis magnetometer, a barometric pressure sensor, and a SAASM GPS receiver. The system also uses Honeywell's human motion-based pedometry algorithm. The navigation process is based on a strap-down inertial navigator aided by feedback from a Kalman filter using typical measurements from the GPS, magnetometer and barometer when available. A key innovation is the addition of an independent measurement of distance traveled based on the use of a human motion algorithm. The navigation system combines the best features of dead reckoning and inertial navigation, resulting in positioning performance exceeding that achieved with either method alone. Subsequent to the Honeywell effort, DARPA funded an individual Personal Inertial Navigation System (iPINS) seedling program. Honeywell worked to improve the baseline personal navigation system with the objective of demonstrating the feasibility of reliably achieving navigation accuracy lt; 1 % of distance traveled in GPS-denied scenarios. In addition, an analysis was conducted to determine the benefit of incorporating terrain correlation into the personal navigation system. The results of this analysis indicate that overall navigation accuracy can be significantly improved through the application of terrain correlation. This presents an are presented. In addition, conclusions from the terrain correlation analysis conducted under the iPINS seedling program are included.},

Approaches addressing the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) typically process the perceived sensor data and do not influence the motion of the mobile robot. In this paper, we present an approach to actively closing loops during exploration. It applies a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter to maintain multiple hypotheses about potential trajectories of the robot and corresponding maps. To prevent the particle filter from becoming overly confident, we present a technique to recover the particle diversity after successfully closing a loop. This way the particle depletion problem is avoided. The combination of our approach with the active loop closing strategy allows to deal with multiple nested loops. Experimental results presented in this paper illustrate the advantage of our method over pervious approaches to mapping with Rao-Blackwellized particle filters.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an integrated approach to exploration, mapping, and localization. Our algorithm uses a highly efficient Rao-Blackwellized particle filter to represent the posterior about maps and poses. It applies a decision-theoretic framework which simultaneously considers the uncertainty in the map and in the pose of the vehicle to evaluate potential actions. Thereby, it trades off the cost of executing an action with the expected information gain and takes into account possible sensor measurements gathered along the path taken by the robot. We furthermore describe how to utilize the properties of the Rao-Blackwellization to efficiently compute the expected information gain. We present experimental results obtained in the real world and in simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Under mild misspecifications of model assumptions, maximum likelihood estimates often remain consistent and asymptotically normal. Asymptotic normality will often hold for the signed root of the likelihood ratio statistic and the score statistic as well. However, standard estimates of asymptotic variance are usually inconsistent. This occurs when Bartlett's second identity fails. In the manner of McCullagh and Tibshirani, a variance correction may be used to adjust the profile likelihood so this identity obtains. The resulting likelihood yields the robust versions of the signed root, Wald and score statistic suggested by Kent and Royall. Assuming model correctness, asymptotic expansions for the first three cumulants of each robust statistic are derived. It is seen that bias and skewness are not severely affected by using a robust statistic. An invariant expression derived for the asymptotic relative efficiency of a robust method allows assessment in numerous examples considered. Even for moderately large sample sizes, losses in efficiency are significant, making the misuse of a robust variance estimate potentially costly. Computer algebra is used in many of the calculations reported in this paper.},

Following the interpolation of last return lidar (light detection and ranging) data into a DEM, a series of 256 reference plots, stratified by vegetation type, slope and lidar sensor sampling angle, were surveyed using a total laser station, differential GPS and 27 interconnected benchmarks to assess variation in DEM accuracy. Interpolation using Inverse Distance Weighting IDW resulted in lower mean error than other methods. Across the study area, overall signed error and RMSE were 0.02 m and 0.59 m, respectively. Signed errors indicated elevations were over-estimated in forest but under-estimated within meadow habitats. Increasing slope gradient increased vertical absolute errors and RMSE. In contrast, lidar sampling angle had little impact on measured error. These results have implications for the development and use of high-resolution DEM models derived from lidar data.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a method for applying particle filters to the problem of search and exploration for autonomous robots. Our approach adaptively controls the resampling stage to prevent premature convergence. Tuning filters is appropriate, and useful, when the subject system is fixed (like a dynamics filter for a particular satellite), but autonomous exploration systems do not fall in to this category. Since they involve traversing and measuring unknown and unpredictable environments, tuning filters for search and exploration is impractical at best. Using a self-tuning filter also adds robustness to faults, which we demonstrate with an example. We compare our new approach to prior particle filtering algorithms in the context of autonomous rovers using sensors to find and approach objects of interest. To facilitate this comparison, we propose a number of simple control strategies that take advantage of the particle filter structure to guide rovers towards areas of expected high payoff. We also introduce a new metric for filter diversity, termed the condensed number of effective particles, to more accurately reflect the amount of useful information maintained by the different algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = { Although it is mandatory to have at least one barometric altimeter installed in each and every aircraft flying within ally air traffic controlled regions to assure vertical separation, the absolute accuracy of such an instrument is rather poor and limited. Basically, a barometric altimeter is a pressure sensor. It measures the atmospheric static pressure and translates it to the vertical height using a predetermined formula. However, as long as all aircraft are equipped with the same kinds of instruments, the vertical separation in any controlled air space is assured. Until recent years, all flight levels (FL) above 290 must be separated by 2000 feet. It was accomplished this way primarily because of the unknown performance of barometric altimeters. By reason of increasing congestion in the air traffic routes near the North Atlantic, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the US = conducted a series of flight tests near Cardiff Wales, UK, to determine whether the separation above FL 290 can be safely reduced to 1000 feet, which would result in doubling the available routes. During these flight tests, a Boeing 727 (tail number N40) was equipped with many recording devices as well as Global Positioning System (GPS). The GPS receiver had capabilities of measuring carrier phase of the received signals so that 3D positions with respect to WGS-84 during the entire flights can be determined down to centimeter accuracy. Among the four (4) takeoff-landing tests, the aircraft conducted these tests using two flying patterns alternatively: Figure-8 with flight level gradually increased from FL 290 to 410 and Racetrack with constant flight level. We observed that the barometric altimeter measurements resemble the kinematic GPS altitude closely except an apparent low frequency difference. In other words, the barometric altimeter had short term accuracy, which would be as good as the kinematic GPS. The objective of this paper is to document these findings. Based on the actual data, we conclude that barometric altimeters are extremely accurate sensors for altitude in the sense of short-term accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of terrain relative navigation systems (TRN) is to augment inertial navigation by providing position estimates relative to known lunar surfaces. Also the purpose of TRN systems is to assist a lunar landing spacecraft with precise and safe landing. Such systems collect the height values from the lunar surface with the help of active range sensors which are then matched within a terrain digital elevation map (DEM) database. Although lunar terrain elevation maps are rare and have low resolution quality, after lunar reconnaissance orbit (LRO) mission is completed by 2010, maps of 20-25 m resolution will be gained. In this proposed work, a model of the lunar surface is developed with terrain generation algorithms. All the possible profiles (height values) and the slopes of the profiles that the sensor may collect during a position estimation phase are determined in advance. The DEM is pre-processed and reorganized into a digital profile attributes database (DPAD). DPAD records are organized in a way to optimize the lander's position estimation process. DPAD data is available as a function of lunar latitudes and longitudes. The DPAD over which the lunar lander is flying is loaded into the lander's memory. A novel TRN algorithm has been developed to estimate the precise location of the lander. This algorithm matches the determined slope values within the DPAD. Where only one match is found, the position of the lander is determined. When more-than-one matches arise, the system iterates until only one position solution is reached. In order to achieve accurate continuous navigation, the sensor should make measurements at specific intervals. The difference between the lander's estimate and the actual height that are measured by laser altimeter, can be used to calculate the position errors, thus providing the lander a continuous navigation solution as in TERCOM [7].},

  Abstract                 = {The harsh environment and limited resources available in the Arctic region make collection of most scientifically relevant data in the area difficult and/or expensive. The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), along with other partners, has developed an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) specifically designed to withstand the difficult environment in the Arctic and capable of collecting a variety of scientific data. This tool has the potential to replace capabilities previously supported by the US Navy SCICEX cruises which used submarines for measuring and monitoring Arctic oceanographic properties. Scientific access to Navy submarines has been severely restricted over the last several years, with the future prospects for continued support uncertain. Ice draft data was one important piece of data historically collected by the submarines that MBARI's AUV now has the potential to provide. This ice draft data has particular value to climatologists and Arctic scientists who are striving to evaluate the impact of global climate on the thickness and extent of the Arctic ice sheet. This paper examines the ice draft data collected by the ALTEX AUV during its engineering test cruise in the Arctic in October 2001. A description of the experiments and the general performance of the vehicle are presented along with the scientific instrumentation layout of the AUV. Further, the modifications made to the ASL Environmental Sciences Ice Profiler instrument to support vehicle operations in real-time are described. The use of this real-time data to drive vehicle decision making during missions is addressed as well. The data acquisition and processing techniques used to determine ice draft are then outlined, followed by samples of the ice draft data itself and estimates of its accuracy and repeatability. The conclusion include lessons learned and future plans for the ice profiling science payload.},

This accuracy becomes increasingly important as we extend the use of DEM data for spatial prediction of soil attributes. Our objective was to compare terrain attributes and quantitative soil-landscape models derived from grid-based DEM represented at different horizontal resolutions (10 and 30 m), represented at different vertical precisions (0.1 and 1 m), and acquired from different sources. Decreasing the horizontal resolution of the field survey DEM produced lower slope gradients on steeper slopes, steeper slope gradients on flatter slopes, narrower ranges in curvatures, larger specific catchment areas in upper landscape positions, and lower specific catchment areas values in lower landscape positions. Overall, certain landscape features were less discernible on the 30-m DEM than on the 10-m DEM. Decreased vertical precision produced a large proportion of points with zero slope gradient and zero slope curvature, and a large number of steeply sloping and more highly curved areas. Differences among DEM from different sources were more significant, with less accurate representation of depressions and drainage pathways with the USGS DEM as compared to the field survey DEM. Empirical models developed from different DEM included similar predictive terrain attributes, and were equally successful in predicting A-horizon depth (AHD) in the validation data set.},

GraphSLAM is closely related to a recent sequence of research papers on applying optimization techniques to SLAM problems. It transforms the SLAM posterior into a graphical network, representing the log-likelihood of the data. It then reduces this graph using variable elimination techniques, arriving at a lower-dimensional problems that is then solved using conventional optimization techniques. As a result, GraphSLAM can generate maps with 108 or more features. The paper discusses a greedy algorithm for data association, and presents results for SLAM in urban environments with occasional GPS measurements.},

The use of a FPGA gives parallelism and will shorten the computing time considerable. The actual computing time has been decreased with over 100 times compared with similar PC applications.

We report a comparative analysis of Doppler navigation obtained employing MEMS AHRS in comparison to Doppler navigation obtained with a high-accuracy inertial navigation system (INS) including a true-North-seeking gyrocompass and high precision accelerometers. The data indicate that Doppler navigation performance with MEMS AHRS is sensitive to instrument calibration including Doppler/AHRS alignment calibration, calibration of AHRS magnetometers for hard-iron & soft-iron errors, and calibration of AHRS angular rate sensors. When carefully calibrated, MEMS AHRS Doppler navigation error is shown to be within an order-of-magnitude of that obtained with high-end INS for the conditions and vehicle trajectories studied. The goal of this evaluation is to quantify Doppler navigation performance using MEMS AHRS. These results may be useful in the development of lower-cost Doppler navigation systems for small and low-cost underwater vehicles.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonlinear estimation based on probabilistic inference forms a core component in most modern GNC systems. The estimator optimally fuses observations from multiple sensors with predictions from a nonlinear dynamic state-space model of the system under control. The current industry standard and most widely used algorithm for this purpose is the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Unfortunately, the EKF is based on a sub-optimal implementation of the recursive Bayesian estimation framework applied to Gaussian random variables. This can seriously affect the accuracy or even lead to divergence of the system. In this paper, we apply a new probabilistic framework, called Sigma-point Kalman Filters (SPKF), to the same problem domain typically addressed by the EKF. SPKF methods have proven to be far superior to standard EKF based estimation approaches in a wide range of applications. Whereas the EKF can be viewed as a first-order method for dealing with nonlinearities, an SPKF achieves second-order or higher accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of a SPKF is of the same order as the EKF. Furthermore, implementation of the SPKF is often substantially easier and requires no analytic derivation or Jacobians as in the EKF. In this paper, we review the fundamental development of the SPKF family of algorithms. These include specific variants such as the unscented Kalman filter (UKF),1 the central-difference Kalman filter (CDKF),2 and numerically efficient and stable square-root implementations.35 We also introduce a novel SPKF based method to fuse latency lagged observations in a theoretically consistent fashion. In the second part of the paper, we focus on the application of the SPKF to the integrated navigation problem as it relates to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomy. We specifically detail the development of a loosely coupled implementation for integrating GPS measurements with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and altimeter. The SPKFbased sensor latency compensation technique mentioned above is used to accurately fuse the lagged GPS measurements. A UAV (helicopter) test platform is used to demonstrate the results. Performance metrics indicate an approximate 30% error reduction in both attitude and position estimates relative to the baseline EKF implementation.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability of an AUV to navigate an underwater environment precisely and for an extended period depends on its effectiveness at making accurate observations regarding its location and orientation. An AUV platform equipped with a side-scan sonar system has the potential to register the current sonar image with previously captured images for the purpose of obtaining information about the vehicle's pose. Image registration is a procedure which transforms images viewed from different perspectives into a single coordinate system. The significance of using image registration techniques in a surveying or monitoring context comes from the fact that the registration parameters could provide the AUV with an indication of the discrepancy between its expected and observed pose vectors. As such, image registration provides feedback which can be used to compensate for drift in inertial sensors or to provide a standalone navigation solution in the event that the inertial navigation system fails. In order for image registration to provide an effective means for feedback a number of requirements on the performance of the image registration method employed must be met. Not only must the method be accurate in the face of possible image variations, but it must operate in real-time using the limited computing resources available within an AUV. In this paper, a number of key image registration techniques are applied to side-scan sonar images. These techniques include those based on the maximization of mutual information, log-polar cross-correlation, the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), and phase correlation. The performance of these techniques is assessed based on a number of metrics including execution time and registration accuracy. The challenges introduced by side-scan sonar imaging systems which degrade the performance of image registration are also discussed in detail.},

A maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is formulated to iteratively find the optimal calibration parameters that best fit to the onboard sensor readings, without requiring external attitude references. It is shown that the proposed calibration technique is equivalent to the estimation of a rotation, scaling and translation transformation, and that the sensor alignment matrix is given by the solution of the orthogonal Procrustes problem. Good initial conditions for the iterative algorithm are obtained by a suboptimal batch least squares computation. Simulation and experimental results with low-cost sensors data are presented and discussed, supporting the application of the algorithm to autonomous vehicles and other robotic platforms.},

The algorithms combine sequential importance sampling (SIS), a selection step and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. They employ several variance reduction strategies to make the best use of the statistical structure of the model.

Traditional methods for attitude estimation via Kalman filtering are beset by many conceptual problems relating to the representation of orientations in linear spaces, leading to difficulties in implementation and the interpretation of uncertainty estimates, among other issues. These problems are compounded when it is necessary to jointly estimate position and attitude. We demonstrate how Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering provides a framework for approaching this estimation problem that is both conceptually appealing and practical. Results are shown that demonstrate the filter's robustness to sensor outages and its ability to perform well even in situations with noisy sensors and high initial uncertainty in all state dimensions; these situations are precisely those in which traditional Kalman filtering approaches are most likely to experience problems},

This data is often in the form of a dense, noisy surface mesh that must be simplified into piecewise-smooth surfaces. The method presented here facilitates this time-consuming task by automatically segmenting a dense mesh into regions closely approximated by single surfaces. The algorithm first estimates the noise and curvature of each vertex. Then it filters the curvatures and partitions the mesh into regions with fundamentally different shape characteristics. These regions are then contracted to create seed regions for region growing. For each seed region, the algorithm iterates between region growing and surface fitting to maximize the number of connected vertices approximated by a single underlying surface. The algorithm finishes by filling segment holes caused by outlier noise. We demonstrate the algorithm effectiveness on real data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {Many intelligent transportation system (ITS) applications will increasingly rely on lane-level vehicle positioning that requires high accuracy, bandwidth, availability, and integrity. Lane-level positioning methods must reliably work in real time in a wide range of environments, spanning rural to urban areas. Traditional positioning sensors such as the Global Navigation Satellite Systems may have poor performance in dense urban areas, where obstacles block satellite signals. This paper presents a sensor fusion technique that uses computer vision and differential pseudorange Global Positioning System (DGPS) measurements to aid an inertial navigation system (INS) in challenging environments where GPS signals are limited and/or unreliable. To supplement limited DGPS measurements, this method uses mapped landmarks that were measured through a priori observations (e.g., traffic light location data), taking advantage of existing infrastructure that is abundant within suburban/urban environments. For example, traffic lights are easily detected by color vision sensors in both day and night conditions. A tightly coupled estimation process is employed to use observables from satellite signals and known feature observables from a camera to correct an INS that is formulated as an extended Kalman filter. A traffic light detection method is also outlined, where the projected feature uncertainty ellipse is utilized to perform data association between a predicted feature and a set of detected features. Real-time experimental results from real-world settings are presented to validate the proposed localization method.},

  Abstract                 = {The heave, tilt, and strain responses of three Antarctic tabular icebergs to ocean waves were measured during a 19801981 cruise of HMS Endurance to the South Atlantic. The three icebergs, located near the South Sandwich and South Orkney islands, were instrumented with accelerometers, tiltmeters, and wire strainmeters, while a Waverider buoy was used to record the ocean wave field. The thickness of the icebergs was surveyed by a helicopter-borne radio echo sounder. The heave response occurred mainly at the swell period but with outbreaks of bobbing which lasted for a few cycles at a resonant period (about 40 s), which agreed well with the predictions of a numerical finite element model. The roll response occurred mainly at a long resonant period (4050 s), which again agreed well with the model, but there was also a significant response at ocean wave periods (520 s), which exceeded predictions. The strain response had a component at very long periods, which is unexplained by theory, while the surface strain at ocean wave periods agreed with the simple analytical model of Goodman et al. (1980). Using this model it is possible to predict a wave height and period that will cause breakup of the icebergs, and we conclude that swell-induced breakup is likely to occur during major storms in the open southern ocean.},

The INS is capable of providing continuous estimates of a vehicles position and orientation. Typically IMUs are very expensive systems, however this INS will use low cost components. Unfortunately with low cost also comes low performance and is the main reason for the inclusion of GPS, compass, and Kalman filtering into the system. Thus the IMU will use accelerometers and gyros to interpolate between the 1Hz GPS positions. All important equations regarding navigation are presented and a discussion of the developed embedded system.

  Abstract                 = {A widely recognized shortcoming of model predictive control (MPC) is that it can usually only be used in applications with slow dynamics, where the sample time is measured in seconds or minutes. A well-known technique for implementing fast MPC is to compute the entire control law offline, in which case the online controller can be implemented as a lookup table. This method works well for systems with small state and input dimensions (say, no more than five), few constraints, and short time horizons. In this paper, we describe a collection of methods for improving the speed of MPC, using online optimization. These custom methods, which exploit the particular structure of the MPC problem, can compute the control action on the order of 100 times faster than a method that uses a generic optimizer. As an example, our method computes the control actions for a problem with 12 states, 3 controls, and horizon of 30 time steps (which entails solving a quadratic program with 450 variables and 1284 constraints) in around 5 ms, allowing MPC to be carried out at 200 Hz.},

  Abstract                 = {Navigation of a deep-sea autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is a difficult task in cases where no absolute positioning information (e.g., by long baseline systems) is available. Using inertial measurement sensors alone leads to accumulation of sensor noise and with it to corruption of position and orientation estimates over time. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques can aid to limit the navigation error. In this paper it is discussed what type of features is suitable for sonar-based underwater navigation. For evaluation, a simulation environment has been created which performs environment shape reconstruction based on side-scan sonar data while additionally utilizing vehicular inertial measurement data (ego-motion). A ray-tracing based forward model creates a synthetic sonar response for a given elevation map and vehicle pose. Then, a pose-aware inversion method estimates an elevation map of the surrounding environment. This map is the basis for navigation. Therefore, the characteristics of the reconstruction method need to be taken into account for the feature design as well as the fact that the surface will be sampled differently upon a re-visit.},

As no global referencing method exists for the deep sea like, e.g., GNSS (global navigation satellite system) for land or airborne vehicles other referencing solutions need to be employed. SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) is a technique that exploits significant environmental features to reduce the positioning error of a vehicle and to simultaneously build a map of the mission environment. It is crucial for SLAM methods to recognize places that have been visited before. In many cases this is done by extracting salient features from the environment. Obtaining those landmarks from side-scan sonar data is a challenging task as the side-scan sonar data does not consist of spatial information but rather represents an echo amplitude over time. In Coiras et al. it is shown how a seafloor shape can be estimated from side-scan sonar data by inversion and regularization. In this paper their method is extended to allow arbitrary vehicle motion.

It should be taken into account when calculating slope from a grid-based DEM. The effect of the accuracy of slope calculation models on terrain analysis based on quantitative models could be very significant. DEM uncertainty and error propagation is hard to describe with a single, fixed and analytical error based on spatial databases. The Monte Carlo simulation technique is an effective method to simulate error fields and can be used to research the DEM errors spatial autocorrelation and DEM uncertainty. The accuracy of slopes is studied and four commonly used slope algorithms, namely, the 2nd Finite Difference, 3rd order Finite Difference, 3rd order Finite Difference Weighted by Reciprocal of Squared Distance, and 3rd order Finite Difference Weighted by Reciprocal of Distance, are compared theoretically in this paper based on the error being spatially dependent and autocorrelated. The theoretical results are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulation experiments using three digital elevation model data sets.},

This paper presents an experiment using a circular neighborhood to calculate slope gradient. Comparisons of the results from a circular neighborhood with the results from some traditional methods show that (a) for a smooth surface, the result from a circular neighborhood is more accurate than that from a square neighborhood, (b) a circular neighborhood is generally more sensitive to noise in the input DEM than a square neighborhood, and (c) in a validation using field measurements, the circular neighborhood performs better than the square neighborhood when the ratio of user-specified neighborhood size to cell size is high.},

A robot exploring and mapping an unknown environment needs to know its own location, but it may need a map in order to determine that location. In order to solve this problem, we have developed ARIEL, a mobile robot system that combines frontier based exploration with continuous localization. ARIEL explores by navigating to frontiers, regions on the boundary between unexplored space and space that is known to be open. ARIEL finds these regions in the occupancy grid map that it builds as it explores the world. ARIEL localizes by matching its recent perceptions with the information stored in the occupancy grid. We have implemented ARIEL on a real mobile robot and tested ARIEL in a real-world office environment. We present quantitative results that demonstrate that ARIEL can localize accurately while exploring, and thereby build accurate maps of its environment.},

In this paper, we develop a kinematic modeling scheme to analyze the skid-steered mobile robot. Based on the analysis of the kinematics of the skid-steered mobile robot, we reveal the underlying geometric and kinematic relationships between the wheel slips and locations of the instantaneous rotation centers. As an application example, we also present how to utilize the modeling and analysis for robot positioning and wheel slip estimation using only low-cost strapdown inertial measurement units. The robot positioning and wheel slip-estimation scheme is based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) design that incorporates the kinematic constraints for accuracy enhancement. The performance of the EKF-based positioning and wheel slip-estimation scheme are also presented. The estimation methodology is tested and validated experimentally on a robotic test bed.},

This paper describes the TERCOM aided INS algorithm and show the divergence problem. To solve the problem, we propose an improved TERCOM aided INS algorithm which corrects the velocity error of INS using linear Kalman filter, even though the navigation system does not have a speedometer.

  Abstract                 = {Skid-steered vehicles are often used as outdoor mobile robots due to their robust mechanical structure and high maneuverability. Sliding along with rolling is inherent to general curvilinear motion, which makes both kinematic and dynamic modeling difficult. For the purpose of motion planning this paper develops and experimentally verifies dynamic models of a skid-steered wheeled vehicle for general planar (2D) motion and for linear 3D motion. These models are characterized by the coefficient of rolling resistance, the coefficient of friction, and the shear deformation modulus, which have terrain-dependent values. The dynamic models also include motor saturation and motor power limitations, which enable correct prediction of vehicle velocities when traversing hills. It is shown that the closed-loop system that results from inclusion of the dynamics of the (PID) speed controllers for each set of wheels does a much better job than the open loop model of predicting the vehicle linear and angular velocities. Hence, the closed-loop model is recommended for motion planning.},

Specifically, the CPU time for the 2.5D method is less than 5% of that of the visibility ray tracing method. Accuracy, on the other hand, is related to that of a traditional ray tracing method and includes accounting for reflected, transmitted and diffracted rays.},

Two strategies for profiling an iceberg with AUVs are proposed. The performance and outcomes are initially analysed in a simulation environment based on MATLAB. The iceberg shape used in the simulation derived from real-world iceberg measurements is provided by the National Research Council Canada. The waypoints in simulations are generated autonomously with a sonar model using a modified 3D Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (RDP) algorithm. The modified RDP filter is programmed to extract the feature-significant data in the points cloud and radially expand them with a standoff distance. Simulation results of spiral and vertical-transit profiling mode are included and compared. The sonar model will be implemented with stochastic estimation, and the collision avoidance features will be developed in the vehicle dynamic section. We are integrating a Tritech Micron mechanical scanning sonar into a Slocum underwater hybrid glider for field verification of this modeling.}

\chapter{Summary and Future Work}
\label{ch.FutureWork}


- Chapter \ref{ch.LoopClosure} laid out some early work in automatically detecting loop closure in natural terrain with poor inertial navigation. 
- Chapter \ref{ch.Results} assumed that these events had been solved, then built a map using the GraphSLAM method described in Chapter \ref{ch.GraphSLAM}. 
-For future work, it would be good to integrate these processes more tightly.
	- Prior work used one loop closure detection
	- My method uses O(dozens)
	- future solutions could effectively use continuous overlap information to produce most accurate maps
- Much more work to be done in analyzing effective ways to use information in natural terrain to detect loop closure reliably

- Space extension 
	- Different sensors
	- More degrees of freedom - should work the same, but can make optimization problem harder
	
-Multi-agent mapping
	- fusing data from underwater vehicles with surface or aerial info, autonomously creating full coverage maps.
